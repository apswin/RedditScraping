       "'\"GC to coordinate\" LPT: Let the engineer know that their details suck. A good engineer will listen and update them on future projects if they can. \"GC to submit calculations and shop drawings for approval by structural\"\\n\\nFuck you design it yourself Then they ignore your calls and laugh hysterically I\\'m working on one right now where GC to submit submittals for all firestopping. Fine and dandy.\\n\\nExcept where arch wants a 3hr firewall to die into an unrated exterior metal curtain wall (PEMB) and it just isn\\'t possible. Not even with an judgement by Hilti/3M. There are details for spandrels but this isn\\'t that.\\n\\nSure the GC should have pointed that out earlier before building it but god-damn, open the firestopping book before drawing the impossible. As an engineer part of the problem is the 35% design/build proposal.\\n\\nBasically we take a design to 35% whereby it gets passed on to a D/B contractor to finish\\n\\nWhere it hurts is that it\\'s difficult to figure how far to go on it because at the end of the day you\\'re not really taking any risk FFP: Fucking Field Problem. \\n\\nThe motto of design phase managers. Verify in field, sucker. Had to do an engineered pick at a Nuke plant.  Told responsible engineer his dimensions/measurements were off due to potentially reversing a couple numbers.  Ex lists space as 26\\'4\" but space is really 24\\'6\".  Told him container would not fit where it was expected to be placed and asked for solution. We need permission to do just about anything at a Nuke plant especially if it\\'s a change.  Engineer tells me as he\\'s siging pick sheet to just do my job, he\\'s the engineer, etc etc.   He didn\\'t realize that I had modified the sheet to state what I told him and that he is responsible for any damage caused as it was a directive and I was trying not to be insubordinate.   Mind you, this isn\\'t on the \"hot\" side  and we are decommisioning the plant so no risk of fuel exposure or a melt down.  We put box were we were told and crushed a small retaining wall in the process.   Whole job gets shut down for a week while it gets investigated.  Engineer gets fired, OE and I (and all other people on site) get \"retrained\" on what to do if this type if thing happens again and we are ALL authorized NOT to do what we are told if it is deemed unsafe. When you‚Äôre walking the job, mention minor changes, they say, ‚Äúsure, no problem‚Äù then during final walk they‚Äôre like ‚Äúwtf is this?! Why didn‚Äôt you follow the prints?!‚Äù You can be happy knowing the architect likely does the same shit to the engineer and whoever is funding the project makes all kinds of absurd requests of the architect. jUsT fOlLoW tHe PrInTs ‚ÄúYes I know the waterline is 2 feet down and you need to make it go down 12ft, you can manage that right?‚Äù Architect\\'s are the morons who do this. \"Let\\'s put a 15 feet cantilever beam for a better elevation\" This is more of an Architect\\'s joke. Unfortunately it\\'s a race to the bottom on fees. Often the first thing to go is the site visit at the start to clarify that the plans match as the architect wants value for money and thinks Thier plans are always spot on. Then we end up having to go back a forth with multiple parties trying to clarify things and we just get told different stories. Sometimes I wish the contractors were more involved in the design just so we can hash out the details more effectively. Especially as a young engineer we are not taught in school how things are actually built so what we learn is essential through trial and error and what the old hands in the company say. If the fee allowed us to actually do the job well instead of just fast then most issues on site would be mitigated. When we don\\'t have the time to actually do the job well we rely on caveats to save us from insurance issues and that is an inherent flaw with the industry at the moment. We are lucky to get 1% of the fee yet are expected to take such high risk. Often the call comes from management and we are offered like lambs to the slaughter to the GC when our work matches the fee. If you want better designs then someone needs to pay for it! ‚ÄúYeah let‚Äôs just wait for the RFIs and CCOs‚Äù My position is specifically stated to take drawings that are 30 years old, 80% complete, or not for the project and operate at a higher level to fill in the gaps. Get paid good, going to be paid more soon. Blame the client. They don‚Äôt want to pay us. ‚ÄúContractor to field verify‚Äù\\n\\nShit rolls down hill, I‚Äôve got two projects the architects changed the floorplans/entrances on after we finished final construction plans. Without telling us. Shouldn‚Äôt this say Architects they cause all the problems You‚Äôve misspelled Architects! Looked good in CAD Verify in field Biggest pet peeve. Should be a requirement to turn a wrench for like 6 months to be an engineer. I‚Äôm looking at you Lennox... \"Making sure they don\\'t get their pants sued off\" Bruh, putting beefy gutters on some wack eaves is hell Reversed plans I had an engineer from Wirtgen out on a job with me once and he was pretty much a master mechanic. And then there is me, a drawftsmen that has a solution and the engineer and construction firm accept my detail\\n\\nIf you ever worked on your own shit with your own plans you learn quick.... Looking at the guys who drew up the plans for the reo. Amen We had a 60ft 8 tonne scroll snap in two. The engineers didn‚Äôt think a hoist or removable floor grates would be required to remove it when the plant was designed. So naturally we had to take 2 stories off the building to lift it out. Turned a 4 day job into a 2 month one It\\'s time for 3d plans. They don\\'t even know the reality of the actual job vs what the print says haha Over the last 15 years I have owned Craftsman, Hitachi, DeWalt, Porter Cable and Milwaukee.  I have used Makita, Panasonic and Ridgid as well... Now I own about $7500 worth of Milwaukee .... If they ever change batteries I am going to cry and then switch to Ridgid! Funny thing is I hear so many mixed opinions of Ryobi tools by pros and homeowners. I don\\'t know what to believe now [deleted] An old lead hand always used Ryobi because he was tired of his Makitas getting stolen. ‚ÄúI buy all my stuff at Harbor Freight, it‚Äôs a great store!‚Äù [Here‚Äôs the relationship between tool companies](https://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Who-Owns-What-Tool-Brands-2019-Update-2.jpg) \\n\\nI‚Äôve seen people shoot themselves in the foot and say Milwaukee is trash and ryobi is better and it‚Äôs just about the name or DeWalt breaks all the time and porter cable is a really old and good brand. \\n\\nI think it‚Äôs important to realize that ryobi is made and manufactured by the umbrella company as Milwaukee. That doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre the same and milwaukee is crap and uses cheap ryobi parts or that ryobi is really good and uses good pro level milwaukee parts. They are different brands and different companies but owned by the same umbrella corp so they have different tools and different designs and different price points. TTI also makes tools for Ridgid which is owned by Emerson. \\n\\nThey‚Äôre both good but you need to realize that ryobi is not a pro level tool and they acknowledge that on their own brand description whereas milwaukee is a pro level tool and designs it to be a pro tool. Haha I think this is one of those scenarios where ‚Äúif it works for what you need it for‚Äù then it‚Äôs great. For example, I was given a fairly new Ryobi battery brad gun. Day to day I use a compressor and that dewalt brad gun, but when I‚Äôve had to run to a house quick for a little finishing touch that battery gun has been phenomenal ü§∑üèª\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I agree that ryobi tools are cheap and lesser than many others in quality. That being said, I‚Äôve got a few ryobi tools that have stood the test of time in regular use.\\n\\nNow, black and decker, that‚Äôs pure uselessness Ryobi Japan makes some really nice tools like mortisers and beam saws that are some of the best around.  \\n\\nMilwaukee and Ryobi North America are owned by the same company, and their tools made in the same factory in China. Moore like \"I\\'m handy, I build my own porch!\" A friend of mine has a ton of the new Ryobi stuff. Honestly it‚Äôs not bad at all for homeowner level work. Doesn‚Äôt Milwaukee own them? I\\'ve had the same 6 piece Ryobi set for about 4-5 years now with no issues, but I\\'m in maintenance and not new construction.\\n\\nThey\\'ve never let me down or failed to perform when I\\'ve had them on the job site. Dad built a deck out back of his house and some of my Ryobi stuff became critically necessary. Their oscillating handle with the right angle impact driver (combination Ryobi and Ridgid) was sinking screws in tight spaces that otherwise wouldn\\'t be possible.\\n\\nI will say that the regular impact driver is still a little short on torque.\\n\\nRyobi seems to get shit on a lot and I get where it\\'s coming from, but for an apprentice trying to break into the field I recommend Ryobi to people because they can get the tools they need to earn those first paychecks and maybe start putting money away to purchase a better more industrial tool set.\\n\\nRidgid has struck me as having excellent build quality and a great warranty on their power tools, can anyone recommend for/against a Ridgid set as an eventual upgrade to Ryobi? I\\'ve gone through a lot of different drills. Dewalt has been the best performing, for the cost, in my experience. Especially when you take advantage of black friday or fatersay deals. This is very specific... No offense to the people that like ryobi, but when I see someone bring ryobi tools on the job I just assume they are just getting started in the construction business. If it works use it but if you need it to last for a long time buy nicer stuff. To me you will look more professional with higher quality tools and if you want repeat business then you need to think about stuff like that. They make a nice hot glue gun I was a DeWalt guy when I was in the business, but now that I\\'m just a homeowner, I\\'ve slowly replaced my collection with Ryobi over the years as stuff stopped working or replacement batteries cost as much as new tools.  I still have my Dewalt impact driver which is going strong and a corded circular saw.  Most other stuff is now Ryobi including my lawnmower and other yard tools.  \\n\\nI can\\'t really complain at all about them - they are plenty accurate and precise and durable enough for my uses.  I have no idea how they would fare in a full-time work environment where durability and long-term reliability under heavy use are critical features. Yeah ummm...  TTI makes Ryobi, Milwaukee, Rigid, and a number of other cordless tool brands.  So avoid Ryobi if you dislike lime green. I really felt this I like the Ryobi cordless nailers, that they balk at the last second if you let go of the trigger, you don\\'t have to turn it on and you can rig the safety by swapping it with the flashlight button looks at my Makita\\n\\nlooks at my office\\'s Bosch I‚Äôve not had single problem with my tools ever (for past two decades), beside regular maintenance, with exceptions. Each tool is taken care of and used for its purpose, without intentional abuse. I own most mainstream brands, including Ryobi. The exception is when I lent it, so I don‚Äôt. Ryobi is starting to grow on me.. \\n\\nResidential GC, and a lot of our subs use Ryobi everything. Plumbers specifically and punch out trim guys. Great cordless nailers and a swath of any tool imaginable at this point it seems. \\n\\nMy Milwaukee and Dewalt tools get worked all day everyday, and have never had problems. Trim nail guns to sawzall and impact guns. \\n\\nBut I must say I‚Äôve used ryobi cordless miter saw, and the 18g nailer for some cabinetry crown punch out, and I was very impressed. Im a California GC. My carpenters helper has ryobi tools. The green tools.  He swore by them for his home projects. He finished his small projects and let his tools sit for a while. When he tried starting a new project at his house, all of his batteries decided they were retired. So, he spent half the money to buy a new, quality set of tools on new ryobi batteries. He used them for his project, but started burning up his tools. This stubborn ass kept buying ryobi stuff because now he had new batteries.   It was a couple years later when he got his first set of Dewalt and that\\'s when he realized what I\\'d been trying to tell him about tools and quality. \"A tool is a tool.\"  No. You get what you pay for. My boss has gone through 3 Ryobi powerwashers in 3 years. Like dude, it\\'s fine for your driveway and siding once a year. but 10 restaurants and 40 appt complexes? \\n\\nJust get us a gas one lmao I can buy 5x ryobi powered caulking guns for the cost of the Milwaukee one, it ain‚Äôt 5 times better. Carrying that other battery charger around is annoying though. \\n\\nI have their little dustbuster too cuz its cheap as hell like $30. When the thing dies from being choked to death by drywall dust I get another one, the festool vac my buddy had was like 500 bucks. Thats like 15 shitty dustbusters! What‚Äôs ironic is that when they first came out, (early-mid 90‚Äôs maybe?)they were pro level tools , and advertised as such in Fine Homebuilding magazine. I could probly find an ad in my magazine collection. \\n\\nI bought the BT3000 table saw, which was like $600 (!) back then, and it was a great saw. Eventually it wore out, I bought the newer version, made in China, it still is working well, and two years ago picked up another older Japanese made mint condition bt3000 for $75 off Craigslist. Ryobi is good for company tools that may end up getting dropped off scaffolding. Hey my ryobi tools started me off just fine while I saved for Milwaukee Hi. I‚Äôm the rigid guy. Or, I might buy festool blah blah blah It\\'s amazing how people are brainwashed by brand names yet consider themselves independent. I have Ryobi, Hitachi, Makita, Milwaukee, Craftsman, Skil, DeWalt, Stihl and Harbor Freight power tools, and so far they\\'ve all held up pretty well. I‚Äôd rather use a rock than a ryobi I actually think Ryobi has some pretty nice woodworking tools. I have a few tools that I bought in a combo set that I had to buy in a pinch.. still working 6 years later. Do I prefer my Dewalt tools for my woodworking or my Milwaukee for all the other stuff? Yes. \\n\\nWould I pick up my Ryobi if it\\'s what was near by? Yes. definitely not that guy but for what I do they work fine but that‚Äôs exactly how I phrase it I thought this was a cuck post at first My response is always \"My wife has a nice set of Ryobi\" You do realize ryobi is literally owned by Milwaukee right? And they are essentially the same tools, with a lower price tag. This is on the poster to get you to sign up to be in construction. And then....the real world. Looks like just about time for sparky to come in and fuck it aaalll up. I have to assume this was an elaborate april fools day prank on a laborer where you all went and worked on another job site without telling them and they then spent the day cleaning up while they were waiting for everyone to show up...Its the only explanation that makes any sense to me. I can smell this picture Job site looks like paradise. Location looks like paradise. That\\'s it everyone is fired.. that includes you snow!! Your HVAC guys are gonna have a nightmare on their hands with all those headers and joist changes. I can drill a 5 inch hole in thoae beams for my 4 inch main right? A safe job is a clean job. Just wait till the electricians show up.\\n\\nDrives my wife nuts.  If I\\'m doing honey do lists for I just drop what I don\\'t need wherever I am standing.  A habit that is hard to break. Ughhh I hate tryin to nail staples into TGIs. Knock outs never line up Jesus those are some long TJIs That\\'s why I\\'m solo. All my sites look like this..... most of the time.... if no one fucks with my system..... my sites never look like this. I can safely say I‚Äôve never once  seen \\na job site this clean and organized Oh my god, this is such a wholesome subreddit. Of course its clean. Wait when its rough in time Looks like a swanky beach house? Gotta pay for quality. It is impossible that this will last Quit taking pictures and get back to work. and everything began getting disorganized again the minute after this photo was taken üòÇ A clean job is a happy job This is amazing. This house looks like a nightmare to run wires in If they love it so much, why don\\'t they keep a clean and organized job site? Wait till messy ass meps‚Äôs get to it! You know? I always thought about doing a ranking of the most messy/rough in the workplace and then a comparative table with Lord Of The Rings species. Like for example, we, the painters would be the Elfs (no less than that ofc.) Masons would be some big strong orc etc. This is like immediately after delivery on a monday I fucking hate Zipwall... Is this a dream?  Is it possible to learn this power? No MEP? Needs more piss bottles Beautiful! Oh so nothing is getting done. Nice stacking job. Can I come work with you? Reminds me of one of my job sites......I miss it. THIS.  Every day. A clean jobsite is a happy jobsite ..makes everything go smoothly.  Also train the men to clean a little bit every end of day and it can stay like that till completion It makes it convenient for scumbags to steal when you leave the job site for the night.... [deleted] The Safety Squint He\\'s forgetting to turn his head slightly to the side. This reminds me of the looks I got from the welders when I told them face shields while using cut off wheels was not optional...I ended up quitting after someone took a hot piece of steel into the ear while torching upside down w/o ear protection. It‚Äôs like everyone took pride in saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù to safety Who here has done a little grinding with their eyes closed because the glasses are all the way across the room? Grind, stop and check. Grind, stop and check.\\n\\nI mean, I\\'d never be that lazy... Just curious if anyone else has?\\n\\nI had crap pulled out of my eye twice last year from ricochets under my safety glasses. I\\'m pretty careful these days, even using a full shield on occasion.\\n\\nWhere is our full cobra commander helmet that the face is perfectly clear, except when auto-shading to the exact tint for acetylene/plasma/welding??? I\\'d pay like, at least $100 for that! Maybe a bit more if it was mirrored and really did look like a cobra commander helmet. That\\'s my weed eater face! It‚Äôs just like how you don‚Äôt need a respirator if you breathe through your nose right? The nose hairs catch it or something. I love you for this This is me. It doesn\\'t stop with glasses. I used to be like that, but after having to go to the hospital cus of some metal in my eye I\\'ve decided to always wear my goggles from now on Hahaha. \\n\\nTeam squint here!\\n\\nHappy to report it has always worked Figured the line was ‚ÄúI use a bong‚Äù Lost an eye in 2012. My Dad was putting a 3.5\" hand nail into the wall, gave it a good swing and it pinged off. Back over his shoulder 10\\' and the head of the nail ripped the front of my eyeball off while it was spinning. Wear your fucking safety glasses. Also, be thankful you can afford to lose one. I laughed way too loud at this. üòÇüòÇ Who is the other actor here besides Leonardo decaprio? thought safety was an afterthought and it didnt apply to me... until one of guys I carpooled with during first year carpentry had a partial zip disk in his safety glasses... But you aren\\'t a J-man without a story of what not to do So dumb but so true Thank you! Had a piece of metal from drilling steel plate lodge into my cornea. Doctor removed it by flicking it out with a needle. By that time a rust ring formed. Proceeded to have that ground out of my eye with what was basically a mini dreamer tool. I don‚Äôt fuck around with the safety squint anymore. take your upvote, you savage. i have a hard time seeing/keeping things straight through goggles and wear them only when absolutely necesary.

As a construction worker, I\\'m torn between still having a paycheck and the crushing anxiety of continuing to report to work... Yeah ive been amazed to see how many people are complaining about not getting mentioned in the media for being ‚Äúessential‚Äù. No one cares if the wall is leveled bob people are dying. The pizza guy is pissed that he doesn\\'t get a spot. I could care less about gratification, it‚Äôs the people that see us as dirt workers that piss me off cause how are you about to live in a city built by construction workers  while living in a house built by construction workers and look down on them. I dont want a medal... or a cookie... or brownie points... or a pat on the back... I want an extra 10-20% on top as hazard pay.\\n\\nThankyou please.

But i agree with everyone saying they‚Äôd just want more pay, less praise. I\\'m a medic. The praise is patronizing. I ran into a gas leak last month to rip a guy out of the house. Management almost wrote us up and tore a strip off me in the hallway. The patient would\\'ve been dead if they were in there much longer, he was at 30% blood CO concentration. \\n\\nNow I\\'m a hero for going into every dickhead with a colds house to check their temp without the proper PPE.\\n\\nI left construction to make a bigger difference (hindsight lmao), now I\\'m getting ass fucked by the country Ive worked my ass off to keep safe for years. And yet truck driver is nowhere to be found. We just out here. The booze is pretty relevant too. Only a construction worker would post this... And then pee on it This is one of the other facets of rich ruling class getting the poor and disenfranchised to blame each other or hate on those they are told are ‚Äúlesser‚Äù than them.\\n\\nThis is the part where they seek daddy‚Äôs approval. Yep *clapping intensifies* I was a Journeyman Union Laborer and was one of the 1st in New England to go through the apprenticeship program.  You\\'re damn right I was proud to be  Laborer, but it didnt/doesn\\'t define me.   If you are proud of whatever it is that you are or do, that\\'s great and more power to you. Well, construction workers do help to build the buildings that are needed to work in their environments. You don\\'t get extra credit for doing your job. Majestic!

Do the job you get paid to do correctly. Very refreshing to see highest voted comments are about letting the inspectors do their jobs. Maybe you should just do your work so that it\\'s in compliance with spec/code to begin with. I went from residential construction (10 years) to building envelope consultant and this is what I did for a while. Zero experience with commercial roofing to doing construction administration on multi million dollar projects. I relied heavily on manufacturers requirements that I read in the days before the projects started. The biggest thing I think I did correctly was to not be a dick, and just talk with the foreman. They were Usually pretty cool. I would say the majority of the time when I have to deal with an inspector one on one in commercial masonry, it\\'s just to give them samples of mortar or grout or getting photographs of our rebar prior to grouting. But when I have butted heads with them it was because the spec book was obviously cut and pasted from a different project. One instance in particular was a specification book that had an unlabeled set of materials for restoration in it and our project was strictly new construction. I had to sit down with them and explain that this product was for repair of deteriorating CMU, and everything here is new work. This product was for seismic retrofitting of masonry with cracks in it. Even called a few material representatives to bring them in on the conversation. Went a long way to give them a look that we were putting in the work correctly and that we understood what was needed on the project to build it per code. As well as giving them a small education on the purposes of some of the products in the specifications. They took notes for future reference. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt could have started out as a sour experience but ended in them taking a few notes, us seeing eye to eye and shaking hands at the end of the day. I\\'ve since seen her on sites and there\\'s always a joke about what class will be on this time. I had to do inspections on my internship and I actually liked it. The guys didn‚Äôt like me, but the foreman didn‚Äôt mind and often were pretty helpful. Do it right, do it light. Man some of yall really hate inspectors huh? If you\\'ve done it right just show them the code, otherwise let them do their job. It\\'s fun being an inspector and an ex-ironworker, I tell the guys I can do their job *and* mine the company wanted to be able to bill for an inspector on site so they sent me out. I‚Äôm a survey party chief. \\n\\n8 hours of milling I didn‚Äôt say one word. I took pictures and forwarded them to the PE. I had a rookie inspector on a job recently... Over the project I had several really inane deficiencies written by her. She was trained as an electrician but was inspecting my structural stuff specifically a set of stairs. \\n\\nThe one that bugged me the most was this. She wrote me a deficiency and copied the world on it, for my stair grabrails being 37\" from stair nose to top of the grab rail and our shop drawing shows 36\" so it HAD to be fixed so they are installed at 36\". She even included pictures of her tape measure and the rail.\\n\\nI wrote back that per ADA i had anywhere between 34\" to 38\" to top of rail in order to meet code and yes 36\" is nominal if it is achievable but either way 37\" was well within code requirements. I also added that if she would care to look at the drawings a little closer she would see that the stair steps are to have a 1\" oak tread applied over our steel and as you could see from the pictures, the oak was not installed yet. Add the 1\" oak and you get 36\"... And to pile it on, i noted that it was irresponsible to be writing someone a deficiency on any items dimensions if your not talking into account the thickness any items yet to be installed.  \\n\\nHit reply all..... Didn\\'t have any other stupid deficiencies like that the rest of that project. Better to be going by the books and get paid when the books are wrong than to go off the books then have to pay for your mistakes. This is my favorite:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been doing this for 30 years\"\\n\\n\"Great, you\\'ve been doing it wrong for 30 years\" I first started doing inspections at 22 getting paid $11/hr. Learned real quick that if you have confidence and enjoy hanging out and asking questions you\\'ll rarely have a problem. If you come in insecure, you\\'re about as useful as a cock flavored lollypop Younger inspectors are generally more pliable and look at this as their job.\\nMost older inspectors are broken down tradesmen that look at it as a working retirement and they don\\'t follow-up with any continuing education. Regulations are written in blood. They are there for a reason. Mfw the inspector comes in and fails us for a panel with a two pole breaker and says the spare at the bottom needs to be labelled as Spare on the panel I do forming and shoring design work. Always surprises me that there aren‚Äôt more failures at job sites. Went to inspection on stadium job site,  3rd deck 24‚Äù x 48‚Äù cast in place beam 25ft high being poured. Spent months working on the design work. Workers mostly Ignored the plans. On one section Instead of using  our heavy duty shoring legs had a timber 4‚Äùx4‚Äùx6‚Äô on last part of the stack up. After hearing the I‚Äôve been doing this 25 years speech workers scrambled to fix it. I was just flabbergasted. I did a job a while back where the owner was suing the previous GC due to the EIFS system failing. The guy hired all sorts of 3rd party inspectors, including a guy who sat on the EIFS council of Canada, a window testing agency and a roof inspector and they paid for the manufacturers extended warranty so we had to fly their technical rep out for inspections along with the rest of the yahoos. My Super couldn\\'t wipe his ass without 3 people telling him how to do it. My Sub is by far the biggest and best EIFS trade in the province too, half of the details in the manual are his and of the \\\\~$15 million of work I\\'ve hired him for over the years, he\\'s yet to do wrong by me and we chose him specifically due to the complexity of this project.\\n\\nWe ran into a pretty unique condition, where 2 buildings joined and there was a window that pretty much required a window well constructed into the roof. It was essentially a submarine window but the Arch insisted it had the same top line as the ones that weren\\'t sunk into the building. A previous expansion of the building was a big part of the issues obviously. The whole thing was stupid but if they took the window out, they couldn\\'t rent out the meeting room apparently.\\n\\nAnyways, we\\'re trying to figure what the hell to do with this thing. We flew everyone in to take a look. Called a site meeting. I made sure the owner was present because I knew this would be a lot of fun. We had 9 people standing on the roof looking at this sunken window and everyone was scratching their heads.\\n\\nThe guy from the EIFS council turned to my Sub and says \"Bob, I\\'m baffled by this one what would you do?\". I couldn\\'t help myself, I burst out laughing. I would wager the owner got a bill in excess of 20k all said and done from his consultants for this meeting and at the end of the day, they did the right thing and deferred to the guy who does it all day long.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT- Just noticed your username. Nice to see another mensch out there onsites lol. Inspectors make the owners happy. A happy inspector makes for a happy field engineer. \\n\\nDo your job right the first time because it\\'s more expensive to fuck it up and re-do it. A lot of young guys in construction will get upset at the inspector for telling them they have to redo it. I used to be like that as well, getting upset because I don\\'t want to do something twice. But now I\\'m fucking happy as can be if I have to a job twice because I get paid twice to do the same job. \\n\\nYes it should have been done correctly the first time and we told boss man we probably should do it this way, but fuck it double the pay for a single job. Just remember we are always working ourselves out of a job. Might as well make it worth it. I don\\'t know how to cook but I can tell the chef did something wrong if my meal tastes like shit. I love how many down votes this is getting.  The people that post these kind of things don‚Äôt realize what it‚Äôs like being an owner of an expensive asset that needs to be protected.  Imagine you hire a crew that you pay upwards of $1,000,000 to paint a bridge or a water tank and they just decide to do whatever they want and the coating fails within a year because there was no inspector on site.  The contractor got away with your money and now you have to pay to get the job re done the right way.\\n\\nIn my experience the best results have come from Contractor and Inspector working together to get the project done right.  All parties have open communication at all times.\\n\\nNot all contractors will rob an owner but they do exist.  I know if I‚Äôm an owner of an expensive asset that needs re-painting I‚Äôm hiring an inspector to make sure it gets done right.  If the coating fails we will at least know why and who‚Äôs at fault. I don‚Äôt need to know how to program a website in order to tell if it‚Äôs a piece of shit. An inspector doesn‚Äôt need to know how to install a hot water heater in order to determine if it was done wrong. Bro at the end of the day if your inspector doesn‚Äôt sign off on your shit then you‚Äôre fucking it up. My goal with all my inspectors is for them to see enough of my work that they stop bothering to even worry about checking it because they know I do a good job. Now they just show up to BS and sign some papers ü§ô Hey that‚Äôs me! And guess what I might not have ‚Äúwork experience‚Äù but I still know to use a tape measure when laying out a road. I fought a contractor for a month because he‚Äôd measure road widths with his foot and be 2‚Äô wide Nice meme, but why do you have a woman as the incompetent one. I mean construction has a problem with sexism in the worst way. As a structural engineer I‚Äôve had female staff with 20 years of experience showing an intern a construction site and there field team kept asking the intern. I mean come on! adjuster trainee checking in I\\'m a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\\n\\n- [/r/buildingcodes] [\"I\\'ve been doing it this way longer than you\\'ve been alive\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingCodes/comments/hwggzg/ive_been_doing_it_this_way_longer_than_youve_been/)\\n\\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don\\'t vote in the other threads.) ^\\\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* As a quality manager the comments in here are refreshing lol. The book being the drawing and specification. I feel attacked Can I ask how much you get paid as an inspector? I am an apprentice carpenter right now and is something I want to do down the line when I have my ticket. First job as the QC manager.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is going on my wall. They probably are doing it wrong. Especially if they get real mad when you call them out. This is literally me right now, I\\'m 4 months in to being a commercial inspector for my state and I\\'m inspecting multi-million dollar jobs and feel way in over my head haha I know a guy who started a roof Monday. Drawings were terrible so he asked client for clarification.\\n\\nClients asks can\\'t you read drawings.....!\\n\\nThe joiner is very rich, doesn\\'t need to work, was only helping someone out.\\n\\nSo tools packed up and away he went! I was always amused by architects and designers who said, ‚Äúbut it works on paper, look!‚Äù. Right here! I came from a trade background before becoming an engineer.\\n\\nWhen I was a cadet doing site inspections, I was always really respectful and never pretended I knew more than the tradesmen. They respect that in return and whenever I found that some re-bar was incorrect or missing or whatever, they just appreciated me finding the mistake. I wish. No booze at work. Even the holidays.\\n\\nWe had a party chief get a dui. We had to pick him up every day. He lived 45 minutes in the opposite direct of our job sites. \\n\\nI did work for a guy on the side and one of the homeowner gave us beer. It was summer time, and a multi acre site. After 2 beers I was worthless. Having a ticket for a trade should be a requirement for safety officer  positions. A lot of times we‚Äôre engineers send the younger guys and girls to do the inspections so they can get field experience (and so we don‚Äôt have to get off our lazy assess and do it). I chuckle at the comments too. Comply or RFI I honestly haven\\'t had any issues with engineers like yeh they\\'re a pain sometimes, but usually they\\'re just trying to cover their ass which in turn covers our ass. I just wish the new ones were a bit more flexible and more willing to meet us halfway. Road Construction Inspector here, I don‚Äôt usually have these for the actual work it‚Äôs mostly compliance with things around the work like traffic control. I prepared myself really well for my first repar inspection. I caught alot of mistakes and had a huge list of To-Do for them. Felt pretty proud I as a construction manager, agree that these kinds of people suck. I basically call out the worker if they are doing something that the ‚Äûcontract giver‚Äú? (I dunno I‚Äòm german) won‚Äòt be happy to see, and will make things problematic. I‚Äòm never telling them they are doing it wrong, I tell them that technical regulations require a different approach. I had a probably 19 year old inspector on the ADC-Lewis job in Goodyear,AZ project checking slump for a 2 bag patch job.  When I asked him ‚Äúhow wet do you want this concrete?‚Äù He responded with ‚Äúwell how wet does the bag say to make it?‚Äù \\n\\nI called his boss and his boss told me a 6‚Äù is fine I just came here to support anyone that gets harassed by the good old boy network on their first day, but the top comments pretty much have it taken care of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCan you imagine being so threatened by a rookie inspector?  \\n\\nOP got some quality issues on site for sure. It\\'s usually the 400 lb safety guy who\\'s harassing people. Engineers never give me grief. I had a superintendent with no experience attempt to threaten and scare me off of his site after he got one of my reports. Joke was on him, I recorded our conversation (legal in the state we were in). He ended up missing his completion date by 6 months and had to be a couple hundred thousand over budget. Ended up losing his job too.  Fuck that guy but he was my bitch after that recording came out. Lol. An inspector failed my wife on my work which was code compliant.\\n\\nI left the other site and met her at city hall. Grab the chief inspector. While waiting, the guy waiting next to us is like \"new guy?\"\\n\\nAnd we laughed.\\n\\nAnd then his inspection got over-turned. The fact that a woman was used for this meme is really disappointing as a tradeswoman...even if the intent wasn\\'t specifically to slight women, it shows the bias that we all have to fight against every day to do our jobs. The look on a pissy junior PM\\'s face when his boss walks by and tells you that you\\'re doing incredible work. That feeling had me #glowup for the next freezing week. Source: Cut Man on a 500+ 2\\'x2\\' paver job. What kinda insp. Are you? Well if you are a [service provider](https://www.virtualrunnerusa.com/) you must be the master of your profession. \\n\\nThat\\'s why the customer only find skilled and experienced people to do their work. I am okay with this except book is wrong a lot nowdays. Cheap owner, idiot engineer, clueless spec writer, green inspector. Go figure. This couldn\\'t be any more accurate. I just hate when completelt arbitrary or ambiguous codes are enforced by overzealous, or worse, blatantly incompetent inspectors.\\n\\nI have to deal with ridiculous interpretations of \"unclear\" stair and railing codes in the residential sector sometimes. The lack of consistency can be extremely annoying. The absolute scariest thing on a jobsite. ESPECIALLY when they wear pink.

This guy definitely rents! About twenty years ago I spent a couple of years running a 753 Bobcat on a regular basis, maybe 20 hours a week. I did a whole bunch of this kind of shit, not involving a trailer, but only because I didn\\'t think of it. Had another laborer see me doing it and he jumped in at lunch when no one was watching to try for himself and almost instantly flopped it over and got himself a nice head wound and concussion. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s the story about how I stopped being a fucking dipshit with machinery. Can\\'t do a wheelie anymore with the new electronic pilot control loaders.  I miss my old ones haha. Blacksheepskid. He‚Äôs got an Instagram. This is nothing to some of the things he can do /r/osha Wow Why tho, there‚Äôs ramps on the trailer. That\\'s wheelie impressive. https://youtu.be/Rpszgytqkck this is quality oprerator Nice !!!!! That‚Äôs amazing! What a nut! I respect his skills.. I spent so long in excavators the foot controls for the bucket always killed me. We all agree this is a world wide thing right? Your being really generous with year 3 drywaller. Could also apply to painters...\\n\\nAlmost every painter that\\'s been on a site with me has been shitface drunk. Hell, the last foreman for the paint crew I worked with, would have fallen down a flight of stairs if I wouldn\\'t had steadied him. I really don\\'t know how GCs let them stay on site! Last job was at a nuclear power plant, too, where safety officials visited frequently. \"trunk slammers\" Concrete guys in Phoenix üòÇ ELI5 Lmao I sent this on to my drywalling friends. It‚Äôs spot on. On Alone season 3 there was a drywaller. You can tell immediately. Let‚Äôs please make a meme for each trade. Ty in advance Year 3 Drywaller looks like Billy from Stranger Things. Bro dry wall will dey you out try concrete Drywaller in Illinois\\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/Bsaju6E1P4CwiSDS7 Shoulda been \"year x addict\" instead with drywall as the title Then uses it in a presentation about potential hazards. gets praise. Sometimes they spray paint something orange. Lol the amount of things I‚Äôve had to stand on/in front of during photo time is ridiculous when I think about it I was on a job site and we were connecting two buildings by building a new one in the middle. So we have a gravel pit between the two putting in underground plumbing and to get in to the buildings we had to climb up 3‚Äô to get in or out. So the guys later a pallet against the wall. It‚Äôs like this for weeks, safety lady walks by it after awhile and is like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the pallet for?‚Äù I said ‚Äúpeople are using it as a ladder cause we don‚Äôt have a way to get in or out.‚Äù And she was like ‚Äúoh okay.‚Äù And walked off. No picture, no nothing. It stayed like that until they placed the concrete, and the GC breaks their arms patting themselves on the back about how safe they are. later, writes a report Safety man takes picture to later post on r/OSHA for mad upvotes? Paint it orange! As a residential framer I don‚Äôt understand this picture [deleted] I have had the same experience on big projects with the ‚Äúsafety inspectors.‚Äù Rarely any major safety hazards, but the main ones were ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù ladders. It is aggravating that a ‚Äúsafety inspector‚Äù will email my office to get me reprimanded, but won‚Äôt tell me about the violations and let me work with potentially compromised equipment all day. I worked with a GC that was Osha 10 to the T with some extras. Talking tied off above 6 feet, cut level 3 gloves, the whole 9. They caught me crawling on top of cable tray without being tied off (about 9 feet above the floor). Took a picture of me and never heard anything of it. Haha My company takes safety pretty seriously. As a PM, we do weekly safety audits on different crews. We have to take pictures of everything on our safety audit checklist to include in the report, and if there‚Äôs something not right, we have the crew fix it on the spot and take a picture of the corrected problem before we can leave. Pictures of literally everything: fire extinguisher inspection dates and locations, items in the first aid kits, pictures of everyone working to show they‚Äôre wearing PPE, the load charts and service records of machinery, etc. I‚Äôve seen one company that‚Äôs even stricter because their safety guy came on site and started taking things out of OUR work trailer and throwing stuff away because it wasn‚Äôt in THEIR compliance (they subbed us and we didn‚Äôt have their particular labels on safety cans and color codes on tools and extension cords even though we had our own system). In the end, they had to buy us new safety cans because their guy took them off site, but our guys put up a fight about the tools and called me to come sort it out. Most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever seen As a non-safety inspector, taking a picture of something deficient is one of the best ways to get it fixed. Everyone tries to argue until they see you photograph rebar sitting in mud. One of the safety guys for our glazers came out to do an audit of his peeps (glazers had been violating alot of safety rules and we asked for them to have a safety guy on site full time). This guy takes a video of his guys doing some unsafe as shit but doesnt stop them or say anything until they\\'re done. He then sends the video back to his office. Boy got laid into hard lmao. That ass got chewed the fuck out I think I\\'ve been lucky.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen safety dude take pictures, but then he goes to the GC, who then disseminates the ass chewing through the contractor\\'s foreman, which rolls down the chain like shit on a hill.\\n\\nNever been yelled at for not wearing gloves to do delicate work.\\n\\nGot yelled at once for looping a tie off to the rail on a lift to get some travel, but that\\'s about it. I don\\'t get it. The safety man is covering up the safety hazard? Safety lady* I work in manufacturing. About 2 years ago my work went through some changes and all management and upper staff got radios. At some point one guy, a nice guy but a bit of a brown-noser, got a hold of a spare one. Just to have. To feel more important i guess. Alot of people had some fun with it. some even got some wood blocks and painted them black and would pretend to talk on them around him. Keep your radio, give me blueprints and leave me the fuck alone lol I won\\'t answer the radio unless they call me Captain Kirk. I\\'m definitely getting a superintendent vibe from the guy in the bottom right Nice pull bruh! This remind me, I should see if there are any new episodes of \"Refined\". I need a source on this pic! Expect if we get the radio it\\'s the bosses music only. Old ass country music.\\n\\nGotta be sneaky and play your own music just enough to hear it. Hahahahaha! Totally ten years ago This is every electrician or safety guy! Are you happy or upset? I\\'m truly confused and overthinking the guys emotion. I think they use essential instead of expendable to make us feel better My usual GC is taking some precautions, but we are being pressured to keep going. I just don‚Äôt want to go into anybody else‚Äôs house for a while. Electrician here, so glad to still be working, and it is funny that we are being called essential. Just got laid off. Our work is very essential but we‚Äôre just a big subcontractor so technically the complain who we work for is the essential one not us. Oh well Residential contractor here, I‚Äôm happy to still be working too. Absolutely the same feeling! You have encapsulated my essence https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2020/03/24/answering-8-questions-about-michigans-stay-at-home-order/\\n\\nQ: Is construction allowed under the executive order?\\n\\nA: Some limited forms of construction are permissible, including construction to maintain and improve essential public works like roads, bridges, the telecommunications infrastructure, and public health infrastructure. Construction workers may also undertake such projects as necessary to maintain and improve the safety, sanitation, and essential operations of residences. In addition, businesses may designate construction firms to provide necessary support to the work of the businesses‚Äô critical infrastructure workers. All construction work that is carried out while the order is in effect must be done in accordance with the mitigation measures required under section 5(c) of the order. I\\'m in heavy civil and we are busy with multiple subs on site. . We were happy to hear we are working until we are forced to shut down. But the governor just issued a stay at home order for all non essential workers. But he doesn\\'t define essential, so we will continue until we are forced to shut down. Civil engineer here. Happy to be still working I‚Äôm jealous. I was working doing renovations on homes and got laid off, and that was right before shtf. I tried to get my job back at an old company doing new home building and they said they‚Äôd love to have me back, and two days later told me they were on a hiring freeze. Residential super here. Business as usual except we are suppose to hang a sign in all our houses that says to stay 6\\' away from all people.\\n\\nI also got moved to my own office since my co-workers desks were about 4ft away from me. \\n\\nGrateful to be working though. I\\'m residential and got declared essential.   I\\'m not sure how I feel about it.  One hand I feel like we are just flooding a market while nobody is buying.  I\\'d rather not being working now while my family is sitting at home than later.    Other hand maybe I\\'m wrong and housing keeps rolling like this isn\\'t happening or didn\\'t happen. Welcome to the fire department :) I‚Äôm in residential remodeling. NY state says all trades are essential: plumbers, sparky‚Äôs, painters, carpenters, drywallers...I‚Äôm home for a week, then back to it. Just this past Friday my boss said we were done for a while. But when our president started to flip flop and panic about the economy, my boss fell in step and said we should just go back to work. Same with any construction for hospitals, while it‚Äôs nice to have something throughout the day to keep me busy I wouldn‚Äôt mind the time off either Building a totally unessential road in Australia while everyone I know either works from home or has lost their job. Feel lucky to still be making money (we are doing 12 hour days plus 6 Saturday) but can\\'t help feel uneasy that they are sending me to work while releasing prisoners to spare them from infection and nurses keep posting on social media for everyone to stay home so they can go to work. Fucken weird, conflicted feeling. Really feel like they should shut construction down like everyone else, but I can\\'t just stop turning up or I\\'d be out of a job when this shit cools down. This reminds me of the \"emergency paint job\" I had when a certain someone famous died and the funeral home needed to be freshened up. I haven\\'t felt this essential in years! In my area, essentially everyone is on the list. I suspect our public health officials are looking to make morgues great again. My first thought was ‚Äúnice. I wonder how long it will take them to do the MEP.‚Äù\\n\\nMy second thought was that I‚Äôm a dumbass. That‚Äôs mind blowing Do 9 Amish women also make a baby in a month? Any good bowlers in the bunch? Reminds me of Family Guy, where Peter blows up the barn and they build it this fast. I saw some trucks! \\n\\nSinners... Many men When in doubt, call the amish.... (via carrier pigeon) Many hands make work light. r/gifsthatendtoosoon r/gifsthatendtoosoon I live close to them and one of my job sites is right in their area. I was heading to work a couple weeks ago and it was so foggy I couldn‚Äôt see to drive faster than 30 mph. I said to myself when I got close to work that there will still be Amish in the roads so be careful. Sure enough I finally see the buggy about 20‚Äô in front of me and if I was going any faster I would have rear ended them. I can‚Äôt believe they feel safe enough with us English out on the roads not being able to see and go to wherever they were heading. I don‚Äôt know how nobody hit one on the road that morning. Thank the good lord for sure. No safety harnesses, no safety rails, no fall protection whatsoever.  Little wall bracing, virtually no roof bracing as the trusses are erected.  You can do a lot with free labor and no concern for worker safety. Must be nice to take a 2 hour lunch They got that up faster than the Chinese built the hospital in WuHan It‚Äôs jolly nice of the inspectors to stay on site all day so there were no hold ups. Must remind myself to do that next time. WOW My company has a big factory near Amish country in Kentucky & we‚Äôve used a crew of Amish guys to re-tar the roof. Apparently it was one of the quickest facility jobs we have ever had done. Big crews with a lot of ladders & ropes so the job was done in less than a day. Yes you can see their horses tied off at Walmart and many others stores in that area. They spend a lot of money in all these stores. I want to be Amish now \"\\'\\'Tis a fine barn, but \\'tis no pool, English.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'ohth!\" They would be unstoppable if some one showed them a pocket calculator. It‚Äôs like ants. MFers are nutty doing that with no safety set ups. I suppose how can you with that many personnel? Lucky guys get 2 hours of lunch. I\\'m just going to state that this video started after all the time consuming work was done. Any underground utilities like plumbing, grounding rods, drainage,  ect... Excavation, footers poured and the concrete block wainscot laid (the gray parts of the wall) were all finished before this video started. your excitement, adds to my excitement of this :) I\\'ve wondered how tower cranes were anchored.   Thanks dude! Enjoy the build! We were just starting to prep for the crane base on our job...poured the mud slab on Friday. Then the forming trade informed us that they had to change the crane.....and the design of the crane pad would need to change after 2 months of back and forth on its design in the first place...it involves a deeper base so that mud slab now has to come out and we need to dewater lower....so so dumb. And the forming company had been charging us monthly to \"hold\" the crane. Clearly that was a money grab that hasn\\'t worked out for them because they\\'ll be paying for all rework and the schedule delay it\\'ll cause. I was so close to feeling this excitement of yours. What position are you? Sounds like a fun thing to watch, I‚Äôd be excited too!\\n\\nAlso, is there any more reinforcement/support than what‚Äôs pictured? Like, are there any micropiles or something underneath that slab, or is that area within the picture that‚Äôll be filled with concrete satisfactory enough to handle the load of the crane? Oh man that‚Äôs great! Stay stoked! Got an apprentice right now that loves learning everything an it‚Äôs awesome! He‚Äôs so hyped to learn as much as he can. Dude whatever you do don\\'t leave that site. I\\'ve seen so many guys start on a ground up - then when they finally get to envelope and the site is crowded with 10 times the guys they leave. But being on the crew in the ground to punch list on a job this scale is an experience you might be chasing for a decade if you don\\'t do it (cause I still am). \\n\\nIt\\'ll probably get harder, more frustrating, worse hours, client changes (although you\\'re already dealing with some serious CO\\'s by the sounds of it). \\n\\nI\\'ve done more remodels than I can count, but only a handful of ground up - and I\\'m telling you I\\'d leave it all if I could be front line on this job. \\n\\nBut it\\'ll probably never happen for me, I moved from contractor, to owner side for  while, no I\\'m a PM for an architect, and being on site a couple hours a week doesnt come close. I\\'m surprised the base is actually poured into place instead of bolting. Do they chisel it out each time then? What‚Äôs the psi of that mix? So much going on here that I don\\'t understand. Why is the crane base cast on ground level instead of being below ground level like any normal foundation or column base? Why is there a section of crane mast being cast into the block of concrete instead of holding-down bolts to bolt the crane\\'s baseplate onto? I‚Äôve seen whalers break and walls implode on a pour like that. What a day that was. I think it\\'s leaning to the left a little. Quit being excited you fucking pussy. Now hurry the fuck up and pull the rod. It\\'s probably just the perspective, but this photo makes me want to stop the pump and check the plumb of that section one more time üôà Is it pile supported as well? Is this im Toronto? What GC do you work for?  Is that Downtown Los Angeles? Looks like a little Potain? That‚Äôs awesome I never knew the cemented those huge cranes into the ground. Makes sense. How many pounds will that crane be able to move ? Interesting that you are casting in the first section of the crane tower. All the crane bases on sites I‚Äôve been on (UK) we only cast in the holding down bolts. Have fun and be safe! I\\'m really surprised they didn\\'t put more kickers on their pans/forms when they poured. The forms like great though. Very well constructed from my pov. Field engineer here for a GC in Bay Area California. I get stoked on little things too. My super still does too, he‚Äôs the man. I‚Äôm on a TI job now but looking forward to a ground-up! Good post OP. Enjoy it! I\\'m a graduate engineer and I can\\'t wait to be exposed in the construction site! Definitely looks like SF. Whatcha building? Pretty freakin sweet guy  Damn that enterprise looking rough of the most beautiful things in engineering, the structures <3 Dont ever be ashamed of or loose that enthusiasm Good luck, guy! \\\\^\\\\^ Congrats! Wait til you have the mezz built. Keep taking pictures!!!!\\n\\nIf something goes wrong someone\\'s going to try to fuck you first.  With this picture you can show who was on site, what equipment they were using and that there definitely was X amount of rebar in the form, spaced properly and that it was vibrated.  \\n\\nWorst case you took a ton of pictures and have great material to share your excitement with a kindergarten class on Career Day or something. I really hope the top of the concrete base is well under the finished level (doesn\\'t look it!), otherwise enjoy breaking that out at the end of the project! Nice, keep us updated! Interesting, thanks. From the picture it doesn‚Äôt look that it‚Äôs much lower than the ground floor. I don\\'t see anything wrong with it. You could hammer any nail within a 6 foot radius and pry a nail out of concrete. Ah yes, the extremely sturdy no. 2 yellow pine hammer... that‚Äôs a top-shelf product there my man. I think you\\'re a good friend. If it\\'s going to be used for hitting nails, I hope he\\'s got good accuracy. Ingineearring Nailed it. Looks great for nailing the top of braces Nice can get some velocity with that one! How long handle 18 in ha I bet Thor would not be able to wield that bad boy. He isn\\'t a railroad steel driver is he? The folks over at r/DiWHY would probably love your work. Not long enough Skookum Looks great and now he doesn‚Äôt even need to get out the van My first ever job in construction I got yelled at a lot by the super for choking up on my hammer when framing. I wish I had shown up on the jobsite with this. Don‚Äôt forget your safety glasses on that one. Leverage 19oz Hammer! Swings like a 53oz!!! What a beautiful piece of art! Everything checks out, no reason for concern. Continue work. Lol, he‚Äôll that should become the hammer of shame! \\n\\nAnyone who fucks up with a hammer shall be punished with it! Needs a longer handle I worked with a Russian carpenter who makes his own custom handles. Not quite this long but close. He wasn\\'t the tallest guy so it helped him out. Should‚Äôve used a longer handle I think he should be perfectly grateful! I would post it on r/specialtytools As the saying goes, \\n\\n‚ÄúThe bigger the hammer, the bigger the job.‚Äù I had a random shower thought the other day and I want to act on it. 3 masonry hammers welded together with a axe handle attached. Please tell me you don\\'t work high rise.... There is no way in hell any of the foreman for the company I work for would allow anything but steel handles up top. Leverage level 5000% Extendo Haha side by side, to split block like Zeus would who needs hickory when pine is so much lighter? ultra lite toolbox is the wave of the future. The leverage on this thing is gratifying. I think thats a stick overlapping/sitting on top of an unbroken hammer. Just slap a  ‚ÄúStilletto‚Äù logo on it and you‚Äôll sell one to every wanna be bad ass ..... The only problem is, he‚Äôs not righteous enough to pick it up. can i buy it? If I had a hammer\\n\\nI\\'d hammer in the morning\\n\\n\\nI\\'d hammer in the evening\\n\\nAll over this land Hey man, I feel your pain. My unique problem has been that big sites deciding not to operate has put all of the smaller domestic jobs at the front of the line. Which is putting like 25 dudes on my sites that would usually have me and my two guys on. My worksites are getting busier not quieter, Australia is going alright atm but I am perplexed at the moment. I was working on a project that was pretty critical. I\\'ve been pulled to a stupid one so a subcontractor can get in that space\\n\\nI haven\\'t decided if I\\'m going to work today yet & I\\'m supposed to leave in 45 minutes. I really don\\'t know what to do. I won\\'t lose the job if I stay home, but I just came off a long winter lay off. Glad to see some people actually share this sentiment. Sometimes you gotta say fuck it. My boss said if I don‚Äôt wanna work because of coronavirus can go work at Burger King. I‚Äôm in Chicago doing completely non essential demo work on a hotel that is being renovated. 10 of us wearing rubber gloves and going through at least 10 N95 masks a day. It‚Äôs honestly sickening that we are still working and wasting resources that could go to protect the people saving lives. I truly hope that after all this, people actually remember the companies that did absolutely nothing to help. Told our owner, and my dad (my operator) on our pipe crew that I\\'ll be staying home until the spread is more contained. They started on the line of \"it\\'s one of the safer jobs as far as that goes, what will you do for money, and it\\'s basically you quitting so you won\\'t get unemployment\" I told then that my health, my families, crews, and their health is more important to me than some people more wealthy than them that want houses built. They didn\\'t quite understand where I was coming from, but definitely respect it. Remember that\\'s it\\'s up to you to decide when it\\'s safe enough to work (equipment, and conditions). Be safe or there guys. The comeback is always stronger than the setback. Unless we are building a hospital, a clinic, or re-furbishing an existing factory/plant so that ventilators and other essential PPE can be produced, nothing we do is essential. [deleted] smart, id work for you, my wife is a nurse. ‚ÄúHospitals would be too overwhelmed to deal with our injured asses‚Äù\\n\\nThis is what I keep telling people who, now that they are stuck at home with plenty of free time, think it‚Äôs a good time to take up hiking and think a 4/5 difficulty 8 mile trail is a good starting point. \\n\\nWhen they go out and snap an ankle or fall down a hill, it will be my volunteer search and rescue team going out, getting exposed and risking our own injuries, and you take up a hospital bed because you watched Bear Grylls one too many times. I work for a large commercial GC and out of 166 projects across the country, only 7 have been shut down so far. There is no way we have that many essential projects. Unfortunately, we can\\'t shut down jobs even if we wanted to since we are bound by a contract. Unless the government or the project owners decide to shut down the jobs, then we are on the hook for liquidated damages if we stop work, and the owner\\'s don\\'t want to pay for our extended general conditions so it doesn\\'t seem like they are going to tell us to stop any time soon. Absolutely. The super on our job told us to say 6\\' apart. We\\'re standing 12\\' sheets of drywall. There is no way we can stay 1\\' apart, much less 6. It would be one thing if it was actually an essential project (hospital etc), I understand. But even if the project finished tommorow, office workers wouldn\\'t be able to occupy it anyway since they\\'re non essential.\\n\\nThis will go down as one of the biggest failure of gov\\'ts and employers across the world to protect their people. Most are more worried about the economy. The first couple weeks unlocking the gates and going into work during the Pandemic have been tough. Signs everywhere telling you to stay home. People everywhere watching you from windows as you go about your day as if you‚Äôre the walking dead. \\n\\n\\nI‚Äôve succumb to my fate whatever it be. My only hope is that I don‚Äôt cause illness to my wife or infant son. I do wish the Health Ministries would shut us down. But the longer this drags on the less likely I see that happening.  \\n\\n\\nKeep your social distance they say this will keep the virus at bay. This is unpopular? My company already sent all our masks to the hospital. Imagine working on a project for 3.5 years.  Finally you\\'re about to finish. All the paperwork, finishes and cleaning is done. You\\'re ready for inspections.  If all goes smoothly, you\\'re due for great bonuses.  Then this shit hits the fan. All inspections are cancelled and your ass is furloughed until further notice. Southeast (greater Atlanta area) and home builders are still going strong.\\n\\nWe build decks and fences for some of the largest nationwide builders.  We had so much rain in Jan, Feb. that everything is behind schedule.  So they are making up for it now that the weather is dry(ish).\\n\\nWe are also seeing an increase in renovation projects because people are home and want to get their ugly deck replaced.  I just stand 10-15\\' away from the homeowner as they explain what they want done to the deck or fence.\\n\\nWe are fortunate that we build decks and fences and only have 3-4 guys per crew, and they are following the recommended guidelines.\\n\\nOur supplier has closed their showroom, so we can\\'t just show up and pick up material.  We have to call it in ahead of time and they can load it without contact.\\n\\nAre decks and fences essential, no.  But, if the builder can\\'t finish his build-out, then it doesn\\'t pass inspection, doesn\\'t provide shelter for the new owner.\\n\\nIf the virus infection rate doesn\\'t peak soon, I expect we will be shut down.  But until then we are being as safe as possible. I\\'m in a low infection state and our dumbfuck GC pulled a crew from Colorado and a crew from Washington to our site.  How fucking retarded is that?  Of course, the owner and architect don\\'t live here, so why the fuck would they care? If I didn\\'t hate the two of them already, I sure do now. I\\'ve had the same thought.  I\\'m building a carwash in a town in Texas... About 3 hours from home.  I\\'d just kind of rather be home.  Staying in hotels, having to eat out, and go get supplies puts me around so many more people.  I\\'d rather put everything on pause and wait it out. The owners of our company sent out a fucking joke of a video saying that we will stay strong and get through this. They proceed to tell us to make sure to wear ppe like safety glasses and high vis. \\n\\nAlso stay 6 ft apart from your nearest teammate. Most od the business is concrete, good luck follwing that rule What if I told you that a few weeks off isn‚Äôt going to be worth a pinch of shit. But a few *months*, or SEVERAL months is the answer. How would you feel then? Because I‚Äôm sorry to say but that‚Äôs the reality mate and you very well might not get the choice in a few weeks. 100% \\nNever mind that we can‚Äôt even get the PPE we need to do our jobs... \\nAnd yes, the project I‚Äôm on could wait. I don‚Äôt see how ALL construction has been deemed essential. I cannot upvote this hard enough.  You have no idea how correct you are about receiving care when you are injured, and the resources it takes up.  Let me illustrate a real-life example.  I currently have bilateral inguinal hernias, and they are uncomfortable.  I\\'m a healthcare PROVIDER, I work in surgery, and even I cannot get a slot to have them repaired.  I\\'m stuck waiting until after COVID passes.  Literally all of our resources are being allocated towards COVID, as they should be.  Will I be uncomfortable waiting, yes.  Will I survive?  Yes, I\\'ll be fine, it\\'ll just be annoying.  We aren\\'t even doing surgery for slow-going cancer right now...  #stayhomesavelives isn\\'t just a platitude, it\\'s necessary as a society for the survival of many of our most vulnerable members.  Your generosity in donating PPE goes further than you can even imagine.  That PPE allows providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, cleaning crews, and even some volunteers, to give everything they have towards fighting COVID.  It literally saves lives, and it goes without saying that every life is so, so, valuable. This is an interesting conversation. I have been thinking about this a lot lately. The company I work for is on the smaller side. So it‚Äôs basically a couple guys in a truck. We work outside all the time. We don‚Äôt really interact with anyone besides ourselves and wherever we stop for lunch. So I think for the most part we are ok. But then I had to stop at Home Depot for a box of screws. And I was completely floored at how many people were in there just wandering around. That‚Äôs where I am having issues. But at the end of it, we build decks. This isn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and we should be home. My exact thought. As someone who does insulation and knowing my company is shut down right now, I truly believe all of our PPE which include nitrile gloves and n95 face masks should all be given to medical staff. Just a reminder that some politicians get a good percentage of campaign contributions from contractors. These people aren‚Äôt going to be out their fucking money. Fuck that. Get the fuck out there and work you expendable fucking nothings. This is who we are to them. Could you imagine if just one of us had the power to turn it right back on em? Until then my family doesn‚Äôt eat unless I hit my 40 hours and get my shit squared away. Fuck our labor and loyalty, fuck our health, and the fuck the health of our family. I‚Äôm a Site Manager, currently building 180 open market houses and a load of council houses. We closed our site last week, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to carry on. \\nI struggle to get the guys to wash their hands and respect the toilets as it is - let alone making them work 2m apart and wash hands every 10 mins.... \\nThe amount of people that visit the site every day, makes it even more unsafe! \\n\\nGood luck to you! > I just wanna get this over with and stay the fuck at home for three weeks and then go back and take my chances then. \\n\\nJust want to clarify that the entire point of the quarantine is not to ‚Äúget this over with‚Äù by speeding things up. In fact, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. The point of the quarantine is to draw things out and make the pandemic last longer so that the medical system isn‚Äôt overwhelmed all at once; to allow more supplies to be produced/distributed, more coordinated planning to take place. Staying home for three weeks is not some magic panacea that makes the issue go away. There is no waiting this out, unless you‚Äôre talking about shutting things down until this time next year when, if we‚Äôre lucky, we will finally have a vaccine developed. Life will have to return to some semblance of normal well before this truly passes. The fact is most Americans will eventually get coronavirus and most will not even suffer any ill effects. That‚Äôs not to say your concerns aren‚Äôt justified and your site shouldn‚Äôt down. But frankly I‚Äôm just tired of seeing social media posts to the effect of ‚ÄúI feel like a kindergartner who keeps loosing more recess time bc one or two kids can‚Äôt follow directions‚Äù That‚Äôs not how any of this works Project engineer/superintendent for a big GC here. I 100% agree with you but my company has made it clear that unless a client directs us to shut a project down, it stays open. Like the client on my project hasn\\'t even floated the idea of shutting down temporarily even though my state was one of the first to have a shelter in place order. Kind of sucks because this customer claims to be \"people friendly\" but yet they don\\'t seem to give a shit about the well-being of the blue-collar, construction workers building their new, precious cafe. I drive a forklift for a home builder in SoCal working for a nationwide developer.   Business as usual here except all the bosses are talking a big social distancing game but in reality ignoring everything.  Pouring concrete for the next phase on Friday,  dropping lumber on Monday and back at it. \\n\\nI have told others to stay away from me. If you need me call me.  If you try and flag me down I will drive right by. \\n\\nI\\'m fine going to work,  or staying home.  I just pray we dont, as a business and a trade,  have many accidents wasting valuable resourses at the hospitals. Gst as many of your co-workers as you can to stop going in on the same day I\\'m in the same boat, myself. I work for a contractor. I mentioned my worries to my boss about wanting to isolate and stay home for fear of getting everyone else in my house sick. But I do need money. So as for now and the foreseeable future me and the rest of the crew are working alone on solo jobs for my boss on empty rentals or flip houses. I still dont k ow if I should be but I feel it\\'s better than working in our usual crews Drag up over concerns for your health. At the next safety meeting, stand up, say so, say the company isn\\'t adequately addressing our health and safety, and walk the fuck out. You\\'ll probably qualify for UE. No I‚Äôm desperate for work rn. My government has denied me all access to support so I have no choice but to work. I\\'m really hoping that one of the older Journeyman on site organizes a walkout in the next couple weeks if it gets worse and worse and they dont shut our site down I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I‚Äôm a field superintendent and I don‚Äôt want to call my subs and ask them to work. Then the office cock suckers call and get on my case. They are sitting at home on the couch complaining that we don‚Äôt want to work. The only way they will make money is if we are working. Heck one of them asked me if I would go run a job out of state starting this month. Fuck that. I love this post. Thanks for sharing. It‚Äôs comforting knowing other people feel the same. Construction can wait. IMHO if the entire construction industry stopped for the quarantine, especially with the amount of workers that have been employed by it in the recent boom, it will be the last industry to come back online. \\n\\nThe overwhelming amount of unemployment claims is one item, but when the industry actually can restart, it will be slow. This will cause only the experienced workers to be brought back at first and not even all of them. Most of the older workers and a lot of the mid level will move out of the industry for something more ‚Äústable‚Äù. The apprenticeships will dry up as well. Then we will be stuck with more unskilled tradesmen than experienced ones. It will domino and postpone the next 10+ years of projects. Basically it will cripple the industry and result in decades of poorer quality projects. \\n\\nI understand and your concern and am right there with you. My other major concern is the industry as a whole never really recovering. We still are feeling the shockwaves from the 2008 market collapse and there were large projects still being completed during that timeframe. A complete stop will crush us all. \\n\\nOne item a lot of people fail to see is that if the project cannot get funded, it won‚Äôt proceed. If projects that are currently funded go belly up, it will leave husks of incomplete buildings dotting the skyline. The amount of money and labor needed to recondition or retrofit one of these projects is insurmountable and likely will cause large scale demolitions and multiple, I mean multiple lawsuits, as in a metric fuck ton of lawsuits being filed and undermining the foundation of the industry. \\n\\nMany projects will require cash in hand for the entire project up front. That will scare many to not even begin. \\n\\nI‚Äôm talking about the construction industry going dark for a decade, at least. But that‚Äôs just my lowly opinion. I hope to hell im wrong. I was talking to my former VP yesterday who does work all over the US. His southern projects are still going strong. Most people are working. Midwest is pretty well shut down. So far $80 million in work in process and no CV-19.\\n\\nEDIT: I was surprised that jobs were still going, but there are a lot of states without mandatory quarantine. I have nothing else to say here except- I like you, man. You‚Äôre a good dude and you make sense. Our govorner had all major contractors in the state do an inventory of PPE. Almost all companies have halted major upcoming projects and finished the ones they had going on and then stopped the majority of non essential projects. The smaller home contractors are ignoring the SIP order and continuing operations. The smaller contractors are the ones who don\\'t have safety training, PPE, or first aid on site. So that\\'s cool. We are not disposable. Well said I stopped going on my own it was messing with my head too much  \\nSome of our jobs gathered all the dust mask to give to first responders We are the only assholes still working at full manpower levels. 700 men in a site and minimal hygiene resources. The GC and ownership can kiss my ass. Commercial HVAC foreman in Atlanta .\\n\\nNervous as hell , I am running a job with over 300 plus swinging hammers on site.\\nWe all share 25 shiters no paper no soap or water.   As for hand sanitizer or cleaning supply‚Äôs I am not so sure that these things even exist.  \\n\\nThe higher ups on the job have all gone to teleworking and all job meetings including stretch and flex and safety meetings have been canceled.   When questioned when are we shutting down the simple answer is not until some one on site tests positive.\\n\\nI personally don‚Äôt want to be here anymore but I have a responsibility to my team who have decided to work until we can‚Äôt.\\n\\nPlease stay safe out there brothers and sisters, My company put out a notice that said that if anyone on a project had symptoms of flu or coronavirus, that job would shut down.\\n\\nSomeone on the GC team for my job just got quarantined last night with fever and cough and guess what job site is still open!\\n\\nNext safety manager who tells me I\\'m putting people at risk by leaving an extension cord on the ground is gonna get a fucking earful Boston shut down all jobsites per order of the mayor (or governor). Unfortunately it takes something like that for those with the deepest pockets to put people over profits. This reminds me of the time I went to an outdoor concert with my wife and she was like EW THESEOUTHOUSES ARE DISGUSTING and I\\'m like what? They\\'re the cleanest I\\'ve ever seen. Most of them dont even have shit on the seat next to muddy footprints I work for a D/B firm. Architects, engineers and others are working from home. Meanwhile, I\\'m about 1,000 miles from home. Job must be completed on time! All construction sites. They treat us like animals I\\'m a Super for a large GC (project is not in NYC or SF) and we are still open. \\n  \\nWe are following CDC guidelines, have double cleaning of all areas (including adding a disinfectant fogging of all common areas inc honey pots), keeping track of anybody who calls in, have told people if they want to stay home for whatever reason they can, and have canceled all in person meetings except the morning huddle.\\n\\nPeople underestimate how many people are pay-check to pay-check. Our guys are happy to have the option to work and not dig into savings. \\n  \\nWe are making sure we are tracking who is out sick for whatever reason. If it jumps, we will shut down. We already shutdown one day and fogged the building when we had our first \\'maybe\\' since testing is so hard to get.\\n  \\nAll our non field staff are def working from home however! Should have stayed a PM!  \\n\\nStay safe everyone! Currently a superintendent for a GC, I tell people all the time that I cant build from home. Trades and construction workers are keeping America Afloat right now My GM emailed me last night and wanted a two week look ahead. I called him and asked him what was going on because I‚Äôve already sent him one. He said they are considering cutting the workforce down to only essential people till this blows over. Till then we are running at 100% Where I work they implemented a liberal leave policy meaning no penalties besides not getting paid for missing work. Today they announced since production is low we can start working seven twelves to make up for production. Union? Well, when you gotta go.... Home remodeler here in the NW. We are all working and hope to keep working so we can keep paying our bills. We are asking clients if they want us there or not. We have work booked out until late fall, but we‚Äôve put one off indefinitely due to the poor health of the owner. Everyone here is healthy and so are their families, so we will keep going. It‚Äôs good to have something to do rather than stay home, and well be forced to work on your own house.... As remodelers, we normally use the client‚Äôs bathroom or in some cases a porta potty, but it‚Äôs just for us, so it‚Äôs not nasty. Thankfully the porta potty crew is still working and willing to keep the toilets clean. No complaints. Everyone wants to continue working. Bills to pay. Kids are all home though. One guy‚Äôs wife does tattoo make up for a living, she‚Äôs still working, so I guess tattoos must still go on.... It‚Äôs ok....the grunts will keep this planet ticking over. Calling all pen pushers...can you push a wheel barrow? I once seen the shit piled OVER the seat of a shitter because the jobsite didnt want to pay the bill. Didnt get cleaned until starbucks complained when we used thier bathrooms. Boston shut down all construction for 2 weeks. Others should follow as most of it is commercial and indoors. Don‚Äôt you union guys have things in place for this? I am fortunate to be a simple handyman. My regulars are still calling and we are all on board with sanitation protocols. If a family member is sick i do not work there. It is a B&G job I‚Äôm just as shocked as you That\\'s pretty much construction everywhere that its not shut down.\\n\\nWe\\'re still working, but a lot of jobs have been shit down. Same story in the UK, construction is always the last worry for people Few of our sites shut down already I heard Friday all construction is shut down is that true? Nary a fuck giv‚Äôn, mate Service electrician here. Honestly I‚Äôm just glad my company gave me the choice to stay home or work if I wanted to. I don‚Äôt expect them to keep paying while I stay home but a lot of people in other fields (bartenders, waiters, etc) didn‚Äôt have a choice. They‚Äôre just out of a job. Doing my best to practice good pandemic hygiene, keeping my distance from customers but I‚Äôm still crawling around in someone‚Äôs attic like any other Wednesday so... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è In Sweden we get paid if we are sick and they say that you should stay at home if you get ANY symptoms. So there is no reason to go work if you don\\'t feel 100%, no doctors note is required.\\n\\nUsually you get no money on the first Day and then you get 80% of your salary, after 5 days you need a note from the doctor saying that you aren\\'t well but the government changed the law to keep the sickos at home. Still only get 80% though i think. Under the law the employer must provide a safe work environment. This is impossible during a viral pandemic. Anything short of sending everyone home with a clean layoff / furlough = gross negligence.\\n\\nNYC just ordered a general quarantine - no gatherings of more than 5 people. Building a building is not an essential service. Take it while you can get it. Should be a lot more worried about what‚Äôs happened to the market and the effect that‚Äôll have on jobs for months and months to come. That being said FM clauses should cover pretty much any shut downs right now. Your local day labor place can get you started. There is no shame in starting as a laborer; I did. If you just do your job, you will be hanging around the other trades all the time. If you have experience, or just a willingness to learn, it will show. I went from laborer to laborer foreman to apprentice carpenter to journeyman carpenter in a few years. Ya it took me 6 months to land my first electrical gig and I love the company and career choice I made.  The only regret I have is not starting as a senior in HS instead of racking up college debt that never materialized into a quality career path, thanks business management I\\'ll hire you as long as you show up on time and want to learn. Just know that pay is based on experience. I have some green kids come in saying they heard you can make such and such per hour in this trade and that\\'s what they want. It doesn\\'t work that way. Apprenticeship! Honestly though, boots, hard hat and safety glasses (own tools if you have any) drive around looking for job sites, go to the office and ask, they appreciate it more [deleted] Just lie about your experience. Hey, if they fire you after a day at least you got that sweet experience! Find a trade that\\'s hiring. I started as an Electrician\\'s Helper. The pay is low but ai knew that going in. What Trade do you want to do? If you got nothing to do grab a broom I felt this in my soul I mean you can also go to your community college and get a welding cert or try to join a union Just a thought but I got my first job in construction this summer, while I was looking I started volunteering with habitat for humanity building houses.\\nGood experience and volunteering history and gets you used to the work so you\\'re pretty much ready to go once you land a job. I ended up getting hired as a demolitions laborer so being in shape for it made a huge difference Seriously, showing up, hustling, taking initiative and accountability with a good attitude- and you will move up quickly Or you look for the shittiest company that is desperate and you work there and let them torture you . At least that\\'s what I did Where do you live? Maybe I can use a guy. Look up local apprenticeship programs Don\\'t give up. I started as a laborer, then apprentice, and so on. Currently a PM and doing alright. Whatever your trade is, learn every inch of it. Only way to do it is to just do it. It takes time to learn a trade, let alone many trades. You‚Äôre gonna have to sweep a lot of floors, or pick up after other tradesmen to learn. Too many kids give up, so not many journeyman are willing to teach, until you prove you‚Äôre not a shitbag. Or join the union and you can chose to be a shit bag or a pro. But these days it‚Äôs really hard to get in if you‚Äôre a shitbag. Unless you know someone. Anyway, I know the struggle. Been in construction my whole life. Work your ass off and have a good attitude every day and it will pay off. Even if your on a shit crew. Stay consistent and show up on time. If you hate your crew but you learned some skills, you can shop around for a better crew. Gonna start off at the bottom again, but hard work pays off. Speaking of, if your in nyc, and want to learn metalwork, hit me up.  \\n\\nIf, as you say, you want to be an electrician, get in the fucking union. Best training, and you get paid to learn. You will eat shit for a couple years, but if you don‚Äôt wash out, you‚Äôll be set for life, and certified. You can always go solo after. IBEW is a legit union for the most part, and you can travel and work anywhere. Good gig. I did it for a minute and have some buddies in IBEW. It‚Äôs a good trade in general. You‚Äôre going to have to take a job grunting. Carrying shit crawling in places. Once you get that job talk to the guys say hey do you need anything wave me over I‚Äôll help you hold something I‚Äôll help you move something. I‚Äôve been on many job sites where helpers were pulled in because when someone was needed at that moment one of the journeyman said that dude over there is been helping me.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre trying to get on with a small company go to their website and learn about the jobs they do learn about the products they use and talk to them in their own language.  Tell them you really envy the way they built their business, you want to work for a company like theirs. Everybody loves to hear about their own accomplishments.  things like that make you stand out.\\n\\nI recommend reading the book ‚Äúhow to Win friends and influence people‚Äù as well It is a very old book but it stands the test of time it explains how to communicate with people in a way that they appreciate. Good luck All you have to do is this:\\n\\nWorker: I\\'ll show up 5 days a week and work 8 hours a day....\\n\\nEmployer: ....\\n\\nWorker: ...\\n\\nEmployer: You\\'re hired. You start immediately experience doesn\\'t even matter here, they are happy enough if some people want to work, construction is very underrated in my country, due small salary propably. I hate it. Just do like me and have a stepdad whose cousin owns a contracting business hire you. I was REALLY lucky to get my labouring job. My brother knows my boss and was able to call in a couple of favours otherwise there\\'s no way I would of gotten it. Sometimes you just need a bit of luck. Do you know anyone who could pull any strings for you? For anyone that was asking I live in Tucson Arizona. If that is the case you are doing it wrong. Oh ok thanks for reminding me of what I‚Äôve done. 25 year journeyman carpenter here in Colorado. Go to a temp agency man, gets your foot in the door.\\n\\nI had same problem last year and now a days when I quit/get fired I usually land a new construction job within 48 hrs. Shits crazy, I couldn\\'t get a call back last year to now company\\'s fighting over me.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nI hope it goes well for you! Try getting *out* of construction.\\n\\nI worked 15 years either solo or running small crews. Decided that I should try and get off the tools before my body collapses on me.\\n\\nI\\'m old enough to understand my habits well enough to know I need structured learning. So I go to a local college for their \"Construction Tech\" open house. Sit through the spiel, break off with the group that seems geared towards the most barebones, entry level coursework. Still felt at sea. Like they were starting two levels above what I wanted or needed to learn.\\n\\nI stayed behind to ask two potential instructors where to start. They kept asking me what my construction office experience was. Maybe I had an internship or student experience. I said, no, I\\'ve worked in construction, on jobs, in my trade, for 15 years. I couldn\\'t make them understand. It didn\\'t feel like it counted for anything. They seemed to think (maybe rightly so) that everyone looking to apply was already an estimator, PM, superintendent, etc.\\n\\nSo now I\\'m just quietly sitting at home, working on computer skills in my spare time with no clear path. It is intensely frustrating.\\n\\nNot sure where this started, but it became me venting/ranting. I\\'m one of very few of my friends who went into a trade and not many people get where I\\'m coming from.\\n\\nI guess I should say, track your hours and experience once you get started, and keep learning, don\\'t stagnate. Where I live there\\'s a terrible shortage of labor. The new generation doesnt want to work. Where are you located? Los Angeles plumbers union starts off $17.30 no experience. Just have to score high on a test or know somebody. Your considered a pre-apprentice. If you decided that, that‚Äôs the career path you want to take, you start the school. $21.10 first year apprentice. Journeyman tops out at $46 I believe. If your a welder/plumber it‚Äôs a few bucks more per hour. Truest thing I‚Äôve ever read. If you can\\'t find a job in construction you must be retarded. I wish I could find someone who‚Äôs just entering the field!  I would love to hire someone who just loves the trades but no experience and I can‚Äôt freaking find anyone. \\n\\nThen when I find someone who knows the difference between a hammer and a drill they think they‚Äôre worth $30 an hour. \\n\\nIs finding people just all word of mouth or what? Thank God the guy in sweat pants and tennis shoes has his vest and hardhat now My company gave me orange, yellow, and pink hi-vis t-shirts  the pink ones look the best imo so I\\'m not sure if I would mind. My last boss would put pink princess duct tape on tool handles to discourage theives One site I worked on had a phase of giving out a very pink vest for when anyone did something stupid. I took great joy in seeing a very large Scottish man wear it. I don‚Äôt even remember what he did to get to wear it. Sadly the higher ups didn‚Äôt think it was a positive thing since it singled out the stupid. But if you was less stupid to avoid the pink that‚Äôs nothing but good for me. Stupid = unsafe The vest of shame This should honestly be a thing. My operator ‚Äúforgot‚Äù his boots, vest and hard hat last week. Showed up in Jordan‚Äôs and a t shirt and man that pissed me off. Of course he can still operate like that as long as he‚Äôs got glasses but I felt like he did that just because not having ppe meant he didn‚Äôt have to get outta the machine to help that day We tried that and people wouldn\\'t give them back afterwards so... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Yup, I\\'ve had pink hard hats in the trailer for this exact thing. Public shaming at it\\'s finest.

Nobody wanted to approach the dog so I had to call animal control. I waited around for them to show up 10-15 minutes. The tech looked over the dog real quick and said ‚Äú poor girl. I‚Äôm surprised she is still alive. She definitely won‚Äôt make it back to the shelter.‚Äù  I then watched him drag this heavy dog by its neck with the stick thing that they used. He said she was too weak to walk on her own.  It was damn heartbreaking watching an otherwise happy street dog quickly approaching death without anyone able to comfort her through all the pain.

Guess what that means?  Your working Easter too ya fuck. I like how the new construction I‚Äôm working on is considered essential... The cops are like non existent in NJ, theyre all busy with other shit. Ive cut my hour and 40 commute home down to 50 mins. Theres 0 traffic, and with 0 cops i can do 95 the whole way home. We haven\\'t hit the \"aren\\'t allowed to leave the house\" point yet, but they have ordered the shutdown of \"non-essential services\". And I\\'m just kind of chuckling that this garage that I\\'m building at a cottage is \"essential\". I thought of it more as a hall pass from the teacher so when you get caught going to the bathroom in school. Idaho was just locked down, but we‚Äôre still going to work. What‚Äôs up with these papers?? Do we need papers? My brother and I do metal work and it‚Äôs only us in our shop. All the customer work is done by email we barely meet them anyway so we‚Äôll just keep goin and try not to die I guess I\\'m going to post this on the main page as well but I wrote this to my superiors because we sometimes to stupid paperwork when we should really be looking out for the guys putting work in place in \"Essential\" Jobsites:\\n\\n \\n\\nMost employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around... \\n\\nSince a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum: \\n\\n1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment)\\n2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces \\n3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.)\\n4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other.\\n5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift.\\n6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)\\n\\nI assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.\\n\\nThe first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.  \\n\\nTo conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.  \\n\\nThis is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. Got mine yesterday. Laminated card and everything! We are ‚Äúessential‚Äù yet ‚ÄúExpendable ‚Äú. The only essential part is turning over the finish product so that the owner can start making money. Ayy just got mine as well. I\\'m an assistant foreman In the electrical field. No excuse here.. we build hospitals. But we‚Äôre adjacent to the largest hospital in the northern part of the state. HR says we won‚Äôt get any help\\nUnless we get sick and we‚Äôd be separated if we make the personal choice to not show up\\nand quarantine. :-/ Apparently putting commercial roofs on Amazon warehouses is essential... Quit the bullshit, why would police care what an employer says?   \\n  \\nNowhere are letters essential from travel, please stop posting this kind of stuff. I laughed way too hard at this. We\\'re not under martial law. They can\\'t enforce this on individuals walking the street.  \\n\\nThat being said, without regular people walking around, I have never noticed how many homeless and junkies there are actually just roaming around. Shit\\'s surreal. Wait wait wait paper work??? I didnt get a single sheet of shit. All this pandemic is showing me is my company doesnt give a fuck about me.... Wait, so martial law? Im going to vent.  State went on lock down. I was deemed essential.  Building a staircase for a homeowner\\'s second home doesn\\'t seem essential to me. \\n\\nSo my question is what is essential and Socially Responsible? [deleted] Skill Tradesmen and women are expendable apparently..I would suggest ‚Äòcalling in sick‚Äô if you are working with a large crew I think you mean a *full face-shield is important when disc grinding.* Electrician here. Reasons like your post are why our company is zero tolerance when it comes to certain PPE. Safety Glasses, Gloves, and Boots at all times regardless of the task. Hard Hat and High vis is optional depending on the generals requirement on the jobsite. Man, That would have really hurt going in to skin if it missed the glasses (not mentioning the total eye destruction if it hit dead on) I have been using those exact 3m glasses.   Good to see they are built for the job. My brother one time used the wrong cutting wheel to grind something down real quick and  it ended up hitting him in his lower ab and causing a deep gash before he even realized the disc had broken. Better go play lottery you got super lucky with that one , today could have been the day you lost an eye What is the other half imbedded in? (Don\\'t have great resolution on the phone...sorry.) I really don\\'t think this picture is real. There are just a few things that don\\'t add up. I don\\'t think a little grinder spins fast enough for this sort of carnage, I\\'ve had an incident with a 9\"grinder that left me shaken but no damage was done to anything in the vicinity. Also, why did it hit his glasses horizontally but the drywall vertically? I\\'m not sure there are too many situations in an auto body shop that would cause you to have to tilt your head 90 degrees while there still being enough room for the wheel to fly with so much force. If it is real I think there were probably a few mistakes made prior to the incident. That wheel was already broken before turning on the grinder. He also would have had shit flying in his face since BOTH of his eyes were apparently in line with the wheel. \\n\\nI\\'m a proponent of PPE but lying isn\\'t helping anyone. Glad you‚Äôre alright man that could‚Äôve been bad!!! Oof.\\n\\nRemember lads, protection is important. This illustrates the point of PPE, however these photos are fake as fuck. Holy sh!t!! What is that piece a part of ? A table saw?? When i was young, i remember using the grinder to get paint and rust off from poles(square hollow tubes used for signs) and a chunk of the blade flung at me, small chunk, rebounded from my upper cheek and embedded into the glassess on the inside lens.... Dam one of these broke apart and hit me right in the neck once, didnt cut me or anything but it was sure as hell a scary experience. I had on a face shield at that. Damn! \\n\\nwet grinder disks? OK, I am never using a grinder without glasses again. Thanks, man. Glad you did the same.\\n\\nedit: Never using a grinder without glasses and a face shield as per comments. I can\\'t believe how dumb and risky \\nI have done shit before. Protective eyewear is important *when using a Metabo Seen my buddy take a disc from his forehead down almost to his chin. Was only centimetres from his eye. If it had been 3 or 4 cm to the left he‚Äôd of lost his eye. \\n\\nWhere I work, it‚Äôs faceshield and glasses or full face respirator when grinding, depending on the task and location. In confined spaces it‚Äôs full face respirator NO MATTER WHAT you‚Äôre doing. Bro you‚Äôre really lucky it didn‚Äôt hit you lower or higher. FAKE, but I always wear eye protection How did this happen? And how to avoid it?  I\\'m a DIYer and im gonna be using an angle grinder for the first time this coming weekend.. Is this bullshit? Everytime one grinder blade cracks on me it just stays there I really wish they would just stop making these discs. Spend a few extra bucks and get a diamond blade. Not being an idiot with a zip disc is also important. Congrats on your first small erection, hopefully many more to come. I\\'m sure in no time you\\'ll move on to large erections. Erected. Hehe My first paycheck as a steel erector was hilarious. Having experience with meta buildings the biggest advice I can give you is to check the anchor bolt dimensions and layout throughout the concrete process. This will save you so much time and heartache\\n\\nBy the way I own a steel construction company and we are proud of our erections! My feet are cold just looking at this. Congrats! You‚Äôll be proud when you sit back and look at the finished product. Word of advice, don‚Äôt let the stress get to you. Stop at a reasonable hour and disconnect. There is nothing in construction that cannot be fixed, except the well-being of your workers. Safety first. üôÇüëç How much more expensive is this than a wood frame? Is that a re-engineered structure? \\nIf so, what brand?\\n\\nCongrats either way.\\n\\nTo those saying it\\'s cold there, this guys the PM so he\\'s most likely not the guy in the field anyway. Keep it up mate It‚Äôs ok man, it was cold af outside Great work! \\n\\nGood luck! Looks good!\\n\\n  Where are you working out of? Looks good. Tell them to install the rod braces or put temp cables-before any wind storms hit .. The steel isn\\'t the only thing here being erected ;-) Is this what it meant by ‚Äústeel elections‚Äù in my construction safety book??? Watch it rise before your eyes! ‚ÄúHave you got an erection yet?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm hoping to get one for Christmas.‚Äù Did anyone tell you its leaning to the left? :-( As long as the columns are fully bolted down and fully connected to the roof framing, it will probably be okay, but if not... MBMA temporary bracing for longitudinal wind? When a job goes well, I get erected too. Congrats! I‚Äôm about to turn 19 hoping to be a PM in a couple years. No temporary bracing to the steel? Shame, what‚Äôs a real ladder if they‚Äôre not there to support you. Step ladder? Just use a bucket /r/ComedyCemetery This might be the pinnacle of dad jokes. Get back to work, dad This ladder is mandatory in my cabinet install truck. Heeey, theres my step-child! Been lookin everywhere for it. Jay London! Last i heard he was in a 12 step program \"You\\'re not my real ladder!!!\" \\n\\nI never met my real ladder, but my step later raised me. But, did it do a good job raising you? I worked for a company that was pretty safety-oriented after a couple of OSHA visits. I was trimming out a window and didn\\'t have my damn step-ladder on me that day. So I was on top of a bucket, and the thing just folded up on me. I hit the floor and really jacked my lower back up. It never would have been a better time for the boss-man to roll up on the site. He literally walked into the room right when I fell and was rolling around on the floor groaning. He had the funniest southern accent, too. So I\\'m on the floor and this guy is just standing over me saying, \"You see, xlitawit? That\\'s why we don\\'t stand on buckets.\" Yea what the fuck is with this? There‚Äôs less people at walmart than home depot it seems. [deleted] While I was waiting on my order to be loaded, I saw at least a third of the people walk out with NOTHING AT ALL. Another third had a small random item like a houseplant, garden hose, lightbulb, etc. \\n\\nThey NEED to accommodate the contractors a lil better so I don‚Äôt have to wait for Karen to buy a fern.

They need to cancel the landscaping section and things would be a lot better Went to home Depot yesterday, twice, and it\\'s worse then Black Friday shopping. I think because of spring and being told you have to stay at home have been the cause of the uptick. Waited over 30 minutes to get in both times. During the week day, middle of the day, when Home Depot is usually a ghost town, the place is packed. Freaking crazy, all the workers yelling to keep your distance, stay out of my box, sir you can\\'t go in there, don\\'t touch that, like I am a little kid. Can\\'t wait till we get back to normal in a few years. I met an old dude just wandering the isles saying \"I\\'m not actually getting anything. I just needed out of the house.\"\\n\\nI\\'ve never wanted to bash someone so badly I have started going to McCoys that is an extra 15min away just to escape the crowd. I work at the busiest Homedepot in Texas we have out line with a 2 hour wait to get in and even then people still come en masse I‚Äôve been making all my supply runs for jobs at 6am when Home Depot opens. I‚Äôm usually loaded into the sprinter and back in bed by 6:45. \\nFriday is the day Jackass Kemp lifted the ban on gyms, bowling alleys and other bullshit businesses. \\nAt noon the wife comes out to the garage and says there‚Äôs no hot water. 15 year old water heater couldn‚Äôt just soldier on for another few months, it had to die NOW! Okay, I‚Äôve got most of my sweat fittings, just need a water heater and expansion tank. As I crest the hill, I think the parking lot doesn‚Äôt look too bad...Wrong! Fucking lot is filled the hell up. I mask up and hot foot it in to the water heaters only to be blocked by scores of idiots wandering around with a singular potted plant in their cart and the whole damn family to do it.\\nI get to the water heaters and there is a guy asking an employee when he needs a new water heater, his is ‚Äúsix years old, is that ready to be replaced?‚Äù Employee sees me waiting for some help to get a 40 gallon on the cart. He tells the guy, ‚Äú I dont work in this department but, I think they last longer than that.‚Äù Finally he tells the guy he will get him somebody and helps me get mine on the cart. The guy was still there after I get my other sweat fittings, just standing around no cart or other items. \\nMunicipalities that responded to the Spanish flu with the most serious measures bounced back economically two to ten times better than areas that treated it like a joke or hoax.

Lowe\\'s hasn\\'t been as busy, been going there lately. Home Depot is my usual go to ... Guilty.

Oh, and furlough. it\\'s cash me not catch me.. The builders merchants I use (for my DIY projects) is entirely closed, not even accepting online orders for delivery. I respect them doing this hugely for the safety of their staff.  \\nHaving said that I am going a bit mad. I also have three missing fence panels that I need to replace. The longer quarantine goes on the more things eventually become essential and it‚Äôs not like you can restrict those people coming to the store to just those people doing essential work. It‚Äôs a difficult problem. That has to be one of the most boring jobs you can have on site. I know he\\'s doing it for his kids at home. What is his job? Just to push the floor number? Good for them for being safe The elevators on my site are 1 person at a time unless everyone is wearing a mask. Probably for the best. It would only take one person in one of the higher traffic areas to get most of the site infected. He lives solo... lol On what, meeting a woman? Was working on a site where a guy had rigged one of these up... He was cutting some forms for concrete that need to be notched around some shit. His foreman saw it and went over there and cut the cord with a pair of side cutters.\\n\\nTold his guy \"take the blade off, quit being an idiot, and fix the cord while I consider if I want to fire you or not.\" You\\'d have to watch your RPM. Spin it fast enough and it\\'s a shrapnel bomb. not sure id use it on the job site, but i would definitely carry it into battle against the office nerds If you‚Äôd installed the guard properly upon unboxing, it actually would not have fit.

Kicked back on him and now he has a scar from his shoulder to the opposite hip. hope he\\'s got the ER on speed dial No way.. nuh uh.. never.. No joke did this with my grinder 6 months or so ago (albeit with a 4.5\" blade) and almost cut off my finger.  Surgery and 20+ doctor visits later my finger still can\\'t straighten.  I had done it plenty of times before, but never again.. I usually put a 6 inch abrasive cutting blade on when I have a ton of cutting to do and don\\'t want to switch blades every 2 minutes. I legit saw a guy from a clients‚Äô crew of property managers carrying this setup on a job. I heard it too‚Äî always made sure I wasn‚Äôt in the room. I have the same angle grinder, it has a guard that would not allow that blade to fit My dad once put a 7 1/4\" steel cutting blade on a 4 1/2\" angle grinder to cut brick.\\n\\nSomehow he survived without killing himself. After spending the last week revamping my company\\'s safety policies, this made head hurt You know if you  can put a 6 1/2\" on there you can also put a 12\" Guy in Seattle carves sculptures with a grinder and series of different size saw blades. He told me he was lucky to survive the learning process. Get this facebook shit out of here.   \\n\\n\\nThis is a really bad idea. So epic, so true A brand new boss I had did this with a grinder on my first day working with him. Sliced right into his hand, spent the day at the hospital.

Keep up the good work! Looks like you hate Dewalt products? Nice op, I‚Äôm trying to keep that attitude but frankly at night I‚Äôm grateful to be working but during the day I doubt my ‚Äúessential job‚Äù. A lot of our customers are really disrespectful about giving space and no matter which tact I take they need to be constantly reminded. Some employees are just as bad. Nice set up man! Keep up the good work! So I see two Stabila levels???? Making bands I see Be safe, keep the hard work and stay positive! (Like I see your doing) cheers! You and me both, and we have the same saw! Stay healthy sir I am working on my house for a while, until a project opens up where i will be the only one there for about a month. \\n\\nI am a Milwaukee guy, but used to have an entire Dewalt set up. That looks nice and professional. Looks like a nice setup!\\n\\n  We\\'re still working residential in Minnesota. \\n\\n  We just started a framing new house and all the neighbors love to stop and watch us work (we\\'re setting roof trusses now). \\n\\n  Some of them have yelled questions from the street, lol. Mostly from the kids.\\n\\n  I think Construction still going kinda gives people hope.\\n\\n  I love that were working, but our crew is only four guys on a lake lot, I\\'d be less thrilled if I was a Commercial jobs with 50 guys. plumber here (rural america), had the whole crawlspace to myself all day, no traffic driving around. Everyone on the job site was following the rules PPE, distancing etc. It might be nice to have people calming down and acting more neighborly, but it does not out weigh the terror that these big cities and hospitals are going through, i hope everyone is staying safe, and your families are well. Washington state won\\'t even allow solo projects like yours...\\n\\nhttps://petitionbuilder.org/petition/construction-work-is-essential-mwsz--2?fbclid=IwAR2jJFXd0sc-ZnGB2cDpNBKW7K6p8xziz5cbYE31BMCVOvLnBau1-5PkcgI Paradise I‚Äôve been working on vacation homes the last two weeks, so I feel pretty safe, until the damn subs show up without any PPE and get in your face. Just going a little slower and being more careful and do regular phone check ins with my husband. Nice! I love that Dewalt saw stand, aren\\'t those just the best? Until today I had a month to turn over a town house. Painted the walls, took seven doors to the strippers, and started working the punchlist. The doors came back last Friday and I put the final coat on today. Then around two I got a panic\\'d text from the owner. The new tenant (who\\'d last week said May 1st,) wants to move in tomorrow... Oh the joy. Until he rips out all the grade stakes and to play fetch with them! /s\\n\\nThat\\'s pretty cool though. Wouldn\\'t fly on my job sites for insurance reasons but I\\'d love to have a job site mascot.\\n\\n Winter of 2015-2016, we were putting up a small pole barn. On a random day a [black lab](https://imgur.com/gallery/3KkjEk3), with no tags, gray hair around the snout, and skinny enough to see ribs, came by. Nicest dog in the world, fell asleep on my coat, just hung around us for the day. Then we never saw it again. Kind of a bummer I wanted to adopt it, it looked like it had no home.   Oh man, we just had a job site and my boss had to bring his dog considering we had to camp for a week or so. You ever seen a chihuahua refuse to back down to a truck delivering trusses? Fucking great.  [I used to bring my pup when I‚Äôd check on our crews.](https://imgur.com/gallery/irIsE79)  One time an architect brought his St. Bernard to an OAC. It shat on the floor twice while he was walking the site. I\\'ve got a pup that is definitely \"that dog\". He hops on the mail truck while our mail chick circles the cul-de-sac, jumps on the UPS truck for a quick inspection when they show up, (chases the FedEx guy for some reason), and was an honorary \"Fire Dog\" for a few hours when a neighboring property set fire to a wooded area out back.  He rolled with the firefighters for a few hours around here and spent time inspecting two of their trucks from the cabs to every open storage locker he could climb into.  Little guy runs this cul-de-sac like he was elected mayor.  Even gets called by my neighbor when they\\'ve got leftover protein or bones from dinner.  He\\'s got this place clocked.  I\\'m guessing the Good Boy supervising the construction site runs his street too.  Their personalities are amazing.  No steel toes or safety glasses so were gonna have to send him home for the day.  My dog comes to the job every day. I usually take him on a walk around lunch when nobody\\'s working but he has to stay in the trailer most of the day. He has the same vest as the dog pictured above. Don\\'t... You dare... Cry! You\\'re on a worksite! The other men will see yo-... Oh... everybody is crying out of cuteness it\\'s ok then :\\') There\\'s a white hound with brown spots that roams a job site I\\'m currently at. He likes to watch the equipment and run in the mud but he won\\'t come anywhere near anyone. We call him yard dog.  Train him to fetch the laser for the pipe at the end of the day. Best pipe pupper There is nothing better than a dog roaming a job site! Had a  small terrier turn up on site one day and put on a cute face for a few days. All very cute till it snuck into my truck and ate all my lunch...being younger then meant I was full I great ideas, so I caught it and sprayed its coat day glow orange with chalk paint. It was all pretty funny till a huge tattooed builder that was working down  the road stormed into site with the highlighter dog under his arm and screamed \"RIIIIGGGHTT - what motherfuckers getting a punch in the head\" All dogs that came on my site go a piece of red flagging tied to their collar. The dog\\'s owners thought it was really funny and knew where he had been all day. He‚Äôs gonna be pooping blood later. looks like something out of trailer park boys Randy? Is that you? No safety harness?  Yes officer, it was him. At least he won‚Äôt get vibration white finger using that method How the f is this guy affording a hilti? The origin of the waist trimmer belt. Guys tryna get *J A C K E D* What song is playing I can do that too, hahahahaha When the extra $600 of unemployment runs out....... RANDY BO BANDY!! FUCKIN CHEESEBURGER GUT !!!! What else is that guy drilling in Grandma‚Äôs house? üòé This is okay if they are social or interested in the work we do. But to just stand there and stare is really annoying. Price just went up by 50% I was a helper for an hvac tech when I was in high school and whenever a customer wouldn\\'t leave him alone or wouldn\\'t stop asking questions he\\'d just put his tools down and talk with them until they realized they were paying to talk to him Not exaggerating, price increases from this. Usually sneak a 10% bitch tax in there. Unusual pickiness will get it too. I\\'ve told a homeowner doing this to go away before. He got all huffy and said it was his house,  he can do what he wants.  I asked him how he would feel if his boss came into his office and silently stared at him for 2 hrs and without a word he turned around and went into the other room. Im pretty sure he was just standing around ther corner listening but at least he stopped staring.  Never worked fore him again though, c that\\'s for sure. I am a retired tradesman, and have watched a lot of the work on my home, due to injuries or lack of physical agility my hands don‚Äôt work like they used to.  So I had to hire subs to do the work . I have seen many shortcuts being taken and not doing the job they were paid to do.  If your paying for the work you should be allowed to inspect the work.  Every tradesman knows there are some skilled guys and not so skilled guys.  It‚Äôs the not son-skilled guys on a crew you need to watch. If I recognize that the work being done is good i can be on my way.  Also that roof is almost flat. I\\'ve had a few customers do this but for the most part I think it was out of boredom and sincere interest in what I\\'m doing.  It still bugs the shit out of me but usually after a while they get bored with that too and leave. Next level...cause he\\'s on the roof with them. I have three pricing schemes.\\n\\n\\\\#1 - Regular install. You tell me what you want, we talk about it, if anything comes up we talk about that.\\n\\n\\\\#2 - You\\'re gonna hang out, watch me and shoot the shit. Price doubles, you\\'re either trying to figure out how to do it so you don\\'t call me next time (or at least until you already fucked it up) or you\\'re gonna waste my time talking to me.\\n\\n\\\\#3 - you\\'re gonna watch me and want me to explain. Price quadruples because fuck you I don\\'t wanna do the job but if you bite I\\'ll do it. I have done this but I usually preface it with \\'do you mind if I watch for a bit? I\\'d like to learn a little. I want to know when I should be calling the professionals instead of making it worse by trying to fix it myself.\\' But then I leave after a few minutes.\\n\\nAlso, if someone isn\\'t at least willing to show me the general idea or explain what they are doing I don\\'t trust them; not on my house, and certainly not on any large job. I wouldn‚Äôt let the homeowner use my ladder. Then it‚Äôs my liability. If he wants to get on the roof do it with your own equipment. A few farts usually do the trick... Call safety inspectors for your jurisdiction On a window install last week my coworkers had a homeowner sit right behind them a while watching you tube videos on how to install windows. It did not go well. Everyone has there own way of doing things and of course they weren\\'t exact with what the video had. Yall couldn\\'t building refineries and Chem plants, you got ten mofos bird dogging you all day everyday Its all fun and games until the homeowner slips climbing down your ladder and sues your company ‚ÄúMY INSURANCE REQUIRES YOU TO BE 50 FEET AWAY FROM ANY WORK BEING DONE‚Äù I had a customer literally set up a web cam so he could watch us while he was away. Have the picture somewhere. Guy was a surgeon and anal as hell about every little thing. When it was all said and done. He tipped me 100$. Still would prefer not to be recorded though. I don‚Äôt think a picture has ever irritated me this much. I don‚Äôt blame him, roof work can have the shadiest shit going on because the owner will most likely never see it What type of van is that? I just has this on a service change and generator inlet install side job. The guy was never more then 10 ft away and demanded explanation for fucking everything..... Strippers prefer viewers. Old mechanics sign..\\n\\nWork $50 /h\\nYou watch $60/h\\nYou watch and talk $80/h\\nYou help $100/h\\n\\nThat said I\\'m happy for the client (or their kids) to watch. I will point out it will go slower and cost more. Every time I leave a contractor alone they do some fucked up half assed work. This usually involves a call back, and they want more money to fix his original fuckup.\\n\\nLast guy said he was going to add a relay to my furnace, and he did. It was laying right on the floor inside the unit all wired up. Next guy left three screws loose, switch wouldn‚Äôt work right. $120 to tighten three screws. The one and only time I\\'ve ever lost it with a customer was in a case like this. They hovered and they criticised and they had the temerity to tell me how to do my job witboit the benifit of my training and experience...\\n\\nJust the worst. I\\'m always cool with people about doing dumb shit. But I won\\'t let ya die during work. We have pod meeting and it\\'s amazing how many chins go down when I bring up safety. Safety is for dorks. Dorks that want to go home alive with all their bits still attached. Companies only care about safety if it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of profits.\\n\\nHear me out, what‚Äôs the biggest thing every construction company claim they live by? ‚ÄúSafety 24/7.‚Äù However, on just about every job site I‚Äôve been on, there are blatant safety violations. This isn‚Äôt a simple case of guys not wearing safety glasses. This is guys riding around in buckets, standing on unsecured loads to use as ladders, and so on. Most of the time I‚Äôve realized it isn‚Äôt that guys don‚Äôt want to be safe, but are basically told to ‚Äúget it done‚Äù by any means possible. This means that often times the proper safety equipment isn‚Äôt available, or it causes significant delays that affect the bottom line. I definitely don‚Äôt agree with this mindset, but I understand why it happens.\\n\\nConstruction is obviously a cutthroat business, where literally time is money. This is why people get agitated when the safety guy shows up, because they know they can‚Äôt run at maximum speed if they‚Äôre required to follow all safety regulations. For a lot of guys, this means the higher-ups questioning them for why it took so long to get something done, so they equate the safety guy to someone standing in the way of production and as someone who only ends up getting them in trouble.\\n\\nThere definitely needs to be change in safety, but it has to happen at the very top with management. They have to understand that safety comes at a cost, and that cost is productivity. Until then, guys will continue to shrug off safety measures in order to appease management. Man... as a redneck that used to do some dumb shit on residential sites, safety can sometimes go overboard. But I‚Äôve also seen a guy unclip his fall protection too early and then fall through a skylight 30 feet to his death on a concrete floor. Do your job well, or find someone that lets you do your job well. There‚Äôs no excuses and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to find that out the hard way. As long as your not an arrogant SOB who thinks he knows more about my trade and our safe work practices, than your alright by me. I try to get along with everyone and Remind myself your just doing your job. \\n\\nBut when it becomes over bearing and a daily thing, that‚Äôs when we got issues. That‚Äôs why my company usually hires their own safety guy to deal with you guys on site. Saves a lot of arguments. Is it reasonabe to fire someone for refusing to follow safety guidelines? I have a day worker (europe) who absolutely refuses to wear a dust mask while sanding down some doors. I buy the guy a dust mask during a pandemic (much harder than normal), and he refuses to wear it, saying he\\'s tough and from region X (a part of europe with loads of coal mines). He\\'s just 23 and I feel like I\\'m resposible for him. I even had to tell him thrice to bring the sanding work outside. This tough guy attitude is so stupid. If I tell you to put your hard hat on, it means put your fucking hard hat on or leave.  It‚Äôs not a suggestion. As a safety guy... I relate so much If you show images of what can happen if proper safety protocol isn‚Äôt followed, people will likely be more interested in listening.\\n\\nEasier to relate when you see a mutilated body part. No you aren‚Äôt. Good luck my friend Be glad we have work when so many others don‚Äôt. Take proper precautions. Be aware of symptoms. And cut yourself off from your older family, as this will likely save them from exposure. Remember we are all essential. Regardless of what anyone tells us. Sorry to hear man! We‚Äôre all in the same boat. Every country, every state, every job site. Stay safe! We are in the same boat in America, my job isn\\'t even that important but we keep working and we don\\'t even have masks, gloves or disinfectant. God bless Sri Lanka. Beautiful country. Stay safe my friend What project are you building? Stay safe brother Covid is kill?\\n\\nNo. But think of the stockholders! Be safe! Keep on keeping on. I feel for you mate. Our company ceased all work last Friday. Take care. That\\'s one Hell of a boss right there. Wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier to make a fold down elevator, or build a ramp to get it in? Awesome, I wonder  if anyone manufactures machines adapted for wheelchair users from factory I don‚Äôt believe this is really ‚Äúmodified by his boss‚Äù.  I‚Äôm fairly certain it came that way from the factory.  A friend of mine uses a big John Deere one for loading large diameter pipe on rail cars and his came with a cab like that.   It allows him to safely get into the cab and then goes up like 20‚Äô so he has a better view of loading the rail cars \\n\\nIt‚Äôs cool but I bet his boss is still a dickhead I‚Äôd like to see this in a real work scenario For a second I thought he was posing next to the wrecked machine that fucked his legs up. That\\'s Frickin awesome! Nextfuckinglevel Please enlighten me. I may have been wrong before once or twice. Also how can I get in this crew? It\\'s fake. But a testament to the human spirit. If willing.  You will find a way. >chimical splashback\\n\\nYup that\\'s a construction site alright. Ah damn. I thought it was every turd over 3\". I\\'ve been extra safe all these years You need to preload a bit of TP in advance as a landing pad. Everyone agrees, a 12‚Äù+ turd that requires no wipe is a start to a good day. One ponders their previous day diet in hopes of recreating such a feat. This is a universal rule, salary and wage. It‚Äôs a rare occurrence that we all share in this accomplishment. Length? Or Width? Is that measured linear along the center line of the turd? Like if if I\\'ve got a long sweep 90 elbow on the end and my end to center measurement is 6\" taking into account fecal allowance but overall is about 13\" 5/8 am I good? OSHA Approved It seems like I see this joke every other week. Is it to much to ask for a little originality from my portapotty humor. I like how these things mysteriously tip over in the middle of the night after the General Contractor is too cheap to have the proper amount and have them emptied regularly... You just through a bunch of toilet paper in and it will land on the paper stopping the splash back My OHS policy, Section 1:\\n- always shit before going to work because fuck site toilets That‚Äôs weird mine says 4‚Äù Why the hell do the idiots feel the need to write on the pissers?\\n\\nEdit: for all of you who complain that construction workers aren‚Äôt respected you can point to this thread as the reason why (the majority of the people here think it‚Äôs ok to destroy our own washroom with bad recycled jokes and racist graffiti).  You get what you give.\\n\\nI‚Äôll wear these downvotes as a crown. At least you got it out of the way for friday. That\\'s why you go home at 3:30 üòÅ It\\'s just having a cat nap Did you have to call safety? Oh shit just noticed that‚Äôs a new machine too. Woof. And that‚Äôs why you keep the door on üí™üèº Oooof, what was that experience like? Any major damage to the machine? Glad you‚Äôre okay! I‚Äôve fallen and I can‚Äôt get up. Just call the rental, and Karen the fuck out of the call about how you specifically asked for outriggers WALL-E NOOOOOOO!!!! I know of a guy who flipped a bobcat into a few feet of water and drowned. They couldn‚Äôt get him out I\\'ve gotten one stuck in the mud but never this It‚Äôs a trap! Don‚Äôt scratch its belly or it‚Äôll attack you! Every day is Monday in construction That looks like a friday 3pm fuck up to me At least the silt fence is okay That ll buff right out!! Just roll her back over Looks like somebody\\'s got a case of the Mondays! It‚Äôs just tired, pretty sure it‚Äôs napping. Awh poor kitty I haven\\'t seen anyone else asking this, so I will: how the fuck do you flip a track skid steer? \"So that wall comes out.. 1689? 1869?\"\\n\\n\"Jesus Christ Bill it\\'s a pandemic, wear your prescription safety glasses\" Ha! Just now I was going through some questions on the plans with my framer. We each stood at opposite ends of an 8\\' table with our own set of plans. Calling out page numbers and details to each other. It took me WAY too long to figure out what‚Äôs going on here. At first I thought you were modeling a 3 phase Wye distribution with tape measures. Don\\'t let your tips touch, thats gay. *Cries in Washington State* This is hilarious to me because I‚Äôm on a non-essential jobsite that has no running water or hand sanitizer and everyone gets close to one another and no one gives a fuck because they think it‚Äôs a hoax. \\n\\nFucking scabs. Just don\\'t cross streams. \"I see your Schwartz is as big as mine\" What exactly is going on in this pic? I legitimately thought you were talking about your dick for 34 seconds and was like oh shit it‚Äôs because of the *FUCKING* üá®üá≥ü¶† Can I share this on my business page as a meme? I can tag you and give you credit! Half the jobs i‚Äôve worked has just consisted of a bunch of dudes just wandering around asking each other if they knew where the _____ was [deleted] This is why all the journeymen I used to work for enforces the tool belt It‚Äôs in your truck somehow Every single day pencils, pliers, tape measure, level or when people ask me for it and I said they had it last because I let them use it. Being a plumber and having way too many tools and materials in my work space, I sometimes think how many minutes are spent JUST looking for the thing I used a second ago. So much efficiency lost... I need help If I set it down I usually know where it is\\n\\nBut of someone moved it I\\'m totally screwed ‚ÄúHey...where‚Äôs your belt?‚Äù I say this about 5 times a day on average to our newest guy. Having to run across the house to get your belt on so you can tell me how long something is is a good way to get a peepee smack This happens at home as well. Then I spend half the time finding the tool or material, and half on the project. did you look right where you left it? Ok... This is what you got to do...\\n\\nGet a belt you like. A nice thick leather one. Should look like a old school weight lifter belt. Not to thick....you still want to get bags and shit on it. \\n\\nGet one bag that fits your tools nicely. Place it on your dominant hand side. This is where you keep your tape, hammer, snips... Whatever hand tool you use. Especially.... Your pencil. Be like ninja swift with your hands. Don\\'t fuck around. \\n\\nOn your least dominant side.. Place your fasteners... Maybe your square too.. \\n\\nGet nice tools. They are yours and you love them. They love you too. Let no one touch them. If you are carrying the weight of them they are yours. \\n\\nThe belt at first might be strange.. But then you will come to the most fascinating realization... That you are, becoming the belt. Suddenly you want to measure some shit.. And you found your tape at the same speed as finding your bird when wanting to take a wiz.. Just natural. \\n\\nGood talk! Now go make money! Yeah me 2, most of the times it\\'s in my holster or my pants but I still spend way to much time looking for it I wish I had that discipline to have a stocked tool belt that I actually used.  My toolchest is the same way, about once every 2 months I gather up all the freekin\\' tools I have used in buckets, other drawers and resort them as they are a mess. They say we can spend as much as 20% of our time looking for stuff. Some days it sure feels like more. The worst is safety glasses on my helmet or hat. More embarrassing than anything. That or pencil behind ear. \"hey George! Where a fu..k is my pencil!!?! Is... It in your other hand,? If you had your bags on you‚Äôd know where it was all the time What did i just do with that thing in my hand just now. - me at LEAST 14 times a day. No joke. I was working under a deck replacing and taking down boards two days ago and I swear I\\'ve never lost a tool that many times in that tiny of a confined space There\\'s no irritation like something vanishing off the face of the earth 9 seconds after using it. At least I\\'m not alone. Best part is I have a pouch to carry shit in, then when I use it, I never put it back. 15 minutes into a task, my pouch is empty and my tools are all over the ground. I thought I was the only adult to loose things that fast. LOL Did you know that walking through a doorway or a portal has an effect in your mind that makes you forget things?  \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s like a program or application in your computer that does not accept an outside source or file format for copy paste.

Fuck that nonsense Beautiful deck though! Why are you standing in it? Ya, no. We would‚Äôve been wrapping it up way before that. We have a rule, if the dirt in a circle we made is soaked. We‚Äôre done! Fuck working in the rain. If those bags are that full, you\\'ve been either standing still for too long or they got filled for internet points. Okay now drink it üò∂ If the ground is soaked, I don‚Äôt work. Not only is it unsafe for myself and my workers, it‚Äôs just generally bad conditions and leads to poorer workmanship. Love the Oxy belt Would have been sitting In my truck once it started to sprinkle. The quickest way to a grumpy contractor is me having to work with wet feet I was caulking the front door to a commercial structure I built in Kentucky one time, dark thirty, with some scant overhead relief, and it was pouring down rain.

The timber lying on the ground, He was standing over it on heaving on each nail one by one. \\n\\nOne nail was jammed in pretty good....he applied force on the bar and the head came off the nail and shot into his eye with permanent damage.

You can always make another panel. Anyone know where this was? Even if that had gone right that‚Äôs a stupid way to lift a load imo. \\n\\nI‚Äôm from the U.K. and that approach wouldn‚Äôt make it past the proposal stage. \\n\\nSurely to god there is a jig that could allow that tilt without putting people in the lifting zone? This was supposed to be a reply to a different comment. It\\'s not a \"mistake\" to call in sick if you\\'re sick, especially right now. Hopefully he gets well soon so you can both enjoy the joke. And hopefully he didn\\'t have the virus or it won\\'t be very funny for you having touched all his stuff. Damn that\\'s a nice set up for an assistant super, I wish I had that set up. Is that a 2019 calendar? Glad I‚Äôm not the only one that calls my jobsite the daycare center. Lol. How many teenagers work in that office? serious question, how are yalls jobsites handling this thing? my site is large with 50+ people minimum. they as of now are not shutting us down. this may change in the coming days but I\\'m curious about other locations. My favourite part is the water bottle.  What state are you? I\\'m in pa... shut down today- Friday This is the bullshit that people not call in sick when calling in when you\\'re sick is entirely the right thing to do, with or without the coronavirus pandemic. This shit needs to stop. I don\\'t know why we in construction feel the need to perpetuate bullshit and take what should be a normal good job and add in all this bullshit that makes it sucks. I know the perps here \"were just joking.\" Stop. You fucking jokes are stupid. How about you just stfu and work? Safety first Sad to see that. Not alot of professionalism. Ah yes... so good ole fashion office pranks... the world needs more of this right now Fair enough That‚Äôs some high quality humour there.  Keep it up.  I hope there‚Äôs some kind of surprise in a drawer.  Like a tuna sandwich Drug test coming up in 3...2..1.. I thought the rubber side was meant to be the bottom I am glad you are safe.\\n\\nmachine can be fixed & replaced. Life cannot.\\n\\nbe safe! Sleepy wiggle wagon ohh look the cat want some petting If it makes you feel any better, off road trucks flip over A LOT. Hope you‚Äôre okay Did you guys just flop it back over with a digger? Have your seatbelt on? She wants you to scratch her belly That sucks... glad you are ok. Gotta ask, how did the company take it?  I scratched some windows on a garage door at work once and the boss man flipped the shit out.  Probably because he wandered around and looked out them alot on his afternoon \"check in\" with his coffee....\\n\\nSucks when shit like this happens.  Shakes your nerves for some time after, at least it does me. At least the front didn\\'t fall off. Tipped her over empty. That\\'s impressive. A bank give away or something? How was the ride? Didja have a nice trip? Shake hands with danger https://youtu.be/v26fTGBEi9E Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre supposed to articulate on multiple axises... Cat tipping. So...what happened? Oops, new county, new job. Move on Wow, flipped the cab as well. Tough luck dude but glad you‚Äôre doing ok. Damn that\\'s scary. Hope you\\'re ok!! Fucked up rebar lists at work at Thursday and the fallout might be just as bad as fixing that. But hey, happy little accidents right? Nice... that cab is fucked. Gonna need to be replaced now lol Yup youre fired m8. Pretty neat but that\\'s definitely not cement. Why does everyone think everything is called cement? What material are those blocks? It looks like he is picking them up easily for being so large. What a waste of time to load that thing with mortar. How many uses can you get out of it before it‚Äôs so caked with shit that it‚Äôs worthless?\\n\\nTrowel is way faster and more efficient. *mortar  Yawn... tried and tested, its slow even with the video sped up... I will stick to my trowel thanks Motherfucker is wearing crocs....just sayin If this guy was a pro he would upgrade his tools to diamond. Looks like he is also building a house out of sandstone blocks. Definately not creeper safe. I have pictures of my 1900\\'s warehouse being build using a box like this to lay the mortar bed...nothing new Pretty fancy, but I‚Äôd like to see his shoe tying abilities.  Good trick of the trade  That\\'s aac block Those blocks are dry it will absorb moisture from that motor üòÅüòÄüòé\\n 1st of all its concrete not cement. 2nd that\\'s mortar. Thanks nice to see some of the underground sub-systems that keep society rolling. That\\'s a lot of rebar in a sewer chamber.  NYCDEP? Is that guy doing his job? What is put around the 48\" CPP to keep the storm water from seeping out/around during construction? Also, does that material work? Installing manholes and doing CIPP repairs right now, but this is another level of coordination...good luck boss. How do you temp in the corrugated pipe? Are there penstocks or something to temp shutoff flow on the main line?\\n\\nIs that CIP vault going to be open to all three outlets, or is a wye being formed between all the RCP sections and the vault just around that?\\n\\nI\\'m curious about the sequence here. RCP = Rain Collection Pipe? From one UG guy to another, that is a nice picture & I would be proud. I believe companies that enforce safe & clean job sites always prevail over the corner cutters in the long run.  Thats badass Cool picture! Saw the pic before I read the title and thought this was a d-box for a waste water system. Then I noticed the guys... that‚Äôs awesome! Shotcrete? Nice work, good and clean job  As a GC, I wholeheartedly agree!\\n\\nSome guys are like crackheads for PPE or small tools. ‚ÄúHey maaaaan, can I get some of those there safety glassssses?‚Äù No motherfucker, I‚Äôve already given you 3 pairs and 2 pairs of gloves. üòê\\n\\nEdit: I have seen this in shops we‚Äôve done work in. The metro shops in DC have a setup like this for employees that need little stuff. They swipe their employee card and can get gloves, glasses, dust masks, etc. I thought it was a great idea. My company tried this for PPE, I don\\'t know why it never caught on.  It was great, you were allowed X amount of points per month to spend however you wanted.  People like me who kept track and took care of our stuff could get all the nice gloves and glasses and the irresponsible could get multiple pairs of the crap.  If you ran out of points you\\'d have to explain why and get personally issued whatever it was.\\n\\nYou can fuck off with the consumables like sawblades and cutoff wheels.  Not all tasks are created equal, some wear blades out quicker than others.  If I need a new blade, I need a new blade.  The time it\\'s going to take me to deal with this shit is going to cost more than just supplying me in the morning with extras. Aren\\'t companies supposed to comply with OSHA standards and supply employees with ppe? At least glasses and gloves. PPE is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt want to use a cutoff wheel that fell down right on its edge. Saves you from using the pink PPE/tools! I wouldn‚Äôt want my grinding disks and cutoff wheels falling like that. If these were common I\\'d probably wear a mask way more often than I actually do The sold out slots were the toilet paper and saftey glasses. Fucking great idea. Love it Where are the diablo blades though Out of curiosity, why are you using SupplyPro instead of Fastenal?  Are you getting better pricing?  Is there a feature that they have you prefer?  I\\'m not affiliated with either, just wondering. Great idea. How do I purchase one? It\\'s all fun and games until something gets stuck in the machine and the worker is not able to continue working and the boss is losing money every moment this machine does that. Who decides what gets placed in these? Are they prestocked? Refilled by a supply company?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOr does the GC of the jobsite decide what gets placed in there? I was a truck driver and I once arrived at a yard that required safety glasses and general PPE. I had misplaced my safety glasses, and they directed me to the vending machine full of safety glasses and other items. Frikin sweet! I bought a hard had from their too, because it was nicer than mine Haha. The prices were very reasonable too. Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Am I the only one that finds the 10\" circular saw blades hilarious... Actually that whole right machine Absolutely! I have been on more than one project where the superintendent wears one of these unironically. (I\\'m in San Antonio) These are ANSI approved and absorbs a hit just the same as a regular hard hat so there‚Äôs no issue with these. That being said, you look like an idiot.  I\\'d be smashing the brim into every ever-loving thing. I\\'d have whiplash by the end of the week. In the almost 20 years I‚Äôve been working in construction, every person I‚Äôve seen wear these were complete douche bags.  these are ANSI approved but not CSA approved. no bueno for Canadian sites.\\n You get a lot of those here in Mexico too , to be honest I‚Äôm always jelly when I‚Äôm in the sun burning and they have that cool shade in their necks and face  Still a safety hazard, they can tell you to take it off if they want. General Clause I need this , together with steel toe cowboy boots  I remember seeing some website that was selling pink, gold, and US flag finished cowboy hard hats.  I found a pair of steel toed sneakers once, much nicer for warehouse work than boots, there was no end to the fussing about them.  Most of the flaggers in our area wear these during the summer. Lots more sun coverage! I see lots of these on all my projects. Not sure why Hispanics are so into cowboys  Janore Deonga approved. These are almost as bad as those cheapo ones with the V on the top  Tory Bruno at ULA has one/wears it regularly which is pretty awesome. I asked and he said the one he wore was code approved...so if it‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs safe!\\n\\nStill love the idea in general, but can‚Äôt justify going out to buy one... i‚Äôd hit my camera on the brim too often. Holy shit my dad has one of these. No idea where he found it seeing as how he works in NJ/NY and I\\'ve never heard of a Polish cowboy. That happened so quick! I feel like Amished some stuff. And no sparkys to turn that frame into Swiss cheese! BTW that brief pause in the video was their lunch break üòÅ What a worthy day though. Not much for religion, but this is a fine example of folks working together. Jimmy Carter\\'s Habitat for Humanity is one of my favorite charities. I\\'d love to have a chance to work on one of these. The fellowship alone would be so memorable. Amish: What is this OSHA you speak of? Just imagine leaving for work and there\\'s not a damned thing on your neighbors property, then you return home amd there\\'s a completed mega barn. Team work makes the dream work. Plus 5 years of chopping trees down and cutting them to size with out modern tech or electricity Ants are such interesting creatures It‚Äôs a fine barn, but no pool it be English. and China thinks they\\'re hot shit for putting up a modular hospital in 10 days.... Anyone know what kind of construction costs these barns end up at ($/sf)?  And what do the Amish charge to have this done?  I‚Äôm curious how the financials work out.  Is it a set turn key price or materials plus labor? This is fake. There‚Äôs no way the electrician could have completed their roughs within that timeframe. If they‚Äôre so Amish then who filmed this They look like ants Its quite amazing what can be done when working together...‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è And no PPE in sight. You can build stuff real quick when there are no safety regulations. So if we were to try this in our world, is it cheaper to quote total job hours or lots of manhours? This is literally that scene from family guy Filmed by a non Amish neighbor, I assume? Thanks for sharing.  How do their labor rates compare to a regular contractor? Kind of cheating to start with the foundation and first floor walls already in place. how did they get the camera out there? What do they use for their waterproofing? I cant imagine they know what Tyvek is... Those are the kind of jobs that make me proud to work in residential lol ü§ôü§ô Off you phone, bastard! I completely agree. No other job task excites me more\\n\\nHappy I left the depressing corporate world for an exciting outdoor job\\n\\nNow they just need to pay me the same haha Atlanta! Lookin good man! I hope the sidewalk below you is closed. Sure doesn‚Äôt look like it here. It‚Äôs this type of shit that made me quit framing. Lol. Glad someone has the balls for it Facia? American Concrete Structures? How about dropping a few bucks on some lanyards that have elastic cord or at least a shock breakaway. A piece of chain would be a bitch to take a fall on. As a GC... Guys being on their cell phones while in a harness is a fuck no. Also... The lack of staging seems like a terrible idea.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep up the good work though. Stay safe. you spelled laborer wrong #nope I couldn\\'t do it I get nervous when roofing a 3 story house I couldn\\'t hang of the side of a building like that Are you a Carpenter or Hollywood stuntman? King of trades, brother id almost be more afraid of dropping something on somebody from that height You guys are badass. Someone\\'s shuttering haha So if that harness breaks, what catches you? Hell yea dog What are you doing? All I see is hooking up a lanyard.... I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more carpenters that also climb. Keep killin it bro! ...And here I am, building fucking Starbucks‚Äô and pouring sidewalks. Just putting this out there... the \"Chernobyl\" miniseries is fantastic. Follow it up with the \"Building Chernobyl\\'s Mega Tomb\" documentary (which is what is posted) for the full effect. \\n\\nMy wife (who barely knows a hammer from a screwdriver) loved them both. Does constructing the dome a couple hundred feet away from ground zero make that big of a difference? Maybe something to do with exponential decay. I saw this documentary on one of the brighter channels. Massive and admirable effort. [Heres how it looks today, cozy and safe.  ish.](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95e1b3a6-a3ae-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700) Can you explain, for the ignorant folks such as myself, what will it be serving for 100 years? There\\'s a really good podcast i think by \\'stuff you should know\\' about how to \\'hide\\' radioactive waste from far future generations.  Signs in current languages would only work for a few millennia before the languages evolved.  Symbols are mostly interpreted and would rely on some degree of scientific knowledge.  Imagine if a pandemic or similar event causes civilization to start again and some bronze age explorers found this structure.  It would soon become known as the cursed temple once people found a way to enter it. Not terrible, not great I never understood why they didn\\'t just shoot like a million yards of shotcrete on that thing and just be done with it. Couldn\\'t you demolish it so that it wouldn\\'t need a cover as big as this? Or will the dust and debris be radioactive and scatter everywhere? didnt it cost well over a billion dollars? I wouldn\\'t work in those conditions.  I hope you\\'re getting hazard pay I\\'m glad you\\'re still with us. Be sure to tell your loved ones how you feel  You better have puncture proof boots on that site!  Expect osha 7 am Monday. Worthy of sounding the air horn Wow I‚Äôm calling Osha. Those things can cause a nasty bruise on your heal. You‚Äôll be out for weeks maybe months. A clean job site is a safe job site.  All apparent impalement hazards must be capped/ protected. As stated in OSHA standards 29CFR No needles? \\nAmetuer. Dear lord... [deleted] Rough day when you‚Äôre eating cat food huehuehue [deleted] Looks like the wrong tool for the job but I like your adaptability and creativity üëç Watched a guy eat lasagna with a plastic cup yesterday so be thankful you have a ruler spatula at least.. I guess. So the thumbnail on my phone made it look like you had a massive gash in your leg and you were measuring the depth with a ruler. Then I was super confused about the fork part of your title. \\n\\nGlad I was mistaken... I‚Äôve been doing trim lately so I just cut 4 inches of cove wood molding.\\n\\nOr I use a stick, or a shim. Never a fork. next time you go into a fast food restaurant, ask for those single wrapped spork... or spoons or forks whatever they have and throw them in your car.  Those are life-savers I have been carrying a camping set in my tool box for years. They nest together and always draw a combination of criticism and awe. Just trim down a shim/shingle and you‚Äôve got yourself a legit fork. Does no one use their driver\\'s license like a civilized person nowadays?!  \\n(/s) One time I cut two small pieces of Ceiling wire and made chopsticks to eat my instant ramen lol Now I know what happened to my coffee stirrer I keep a fork and spoon in my center console for romantic dinners like this. Neil? My friend used measuring tape but this seems better The Bumblebee tuna ones come with a little plastic spoon. Then you don‚Äôt have to worry about it! 2‚Äù of tuna I‚Äôve seen guys use shims a lot. I‚Äôve also seen guys use a bag over their hand to eat some stuff. Better the fork than the spoon... They have some brands that have the spoon in the pouch...a fuckin life saver.... I thought that was a tear in your jeans and you were showing off the gnarliest accident wound I\\'ve ever seen Whenever I forget a fork or spoon a pair of my cleanest safety glasses is getting snapped in half right quick Ah yes.. I remember these days of eating things with minimal tools and heat while in my car come lunch time based on what random food stuff I hastily grabbed from the cupboard half conscious at 6:00am. It was as if  I was ransacking my own house in a post apocalyptic world while being chased by some indescribable horror.\\n\\nWas I ever that young? Just use those dirty hands This pic looked really bad at first.  It looked like you had   Stabbed your leg with a framing square minus the blood. Second best use for a framing square. why eat in the car? First off, sorry for the pic quality. I‚Äôve been planning on carpentry and construction as a career, after taking carpentry and building/structure systems for the past 3 years in school, it only made me 100% sure that I wanted to start in a trade. I recently got accepted into a local union as an apprentice in commercial carpentry, also through a school program I was able to secure $1000 in scholarship funds for tools. Everything on the bottom is something I have bought over the past 2 years on my own (minus my Milwaukee m18 Vacuum and a few HD 12.0 batteries). Everything on the top was something I acquired today with my scholarship fund. I feel like this is a huge step forward for me and my future family, and I appreciate you guys for posting content and explaining things the way you have. Keep teaching us younger kids as long as you can! (Tools purchased today: Small tool box, linesman and end nipper pliers, 2 plumb bobs, a new chalk line, 6‚Äô folding rule, 3 pc. aviation snips, WTG framer tool belt (great quality, comparable to diamondback for about $250, handmade in my state of Ohio), crowbar, tekton 12pc screwdriver set, drywall saw, Irwin hand saw, small tool bag which is underneath the tool belt, my 2nd cats paw, 3 pc. Prybar set, and my personal favorite, stiletto 14 oz. titanium framer. Not pictured are 3 pairs of Carhartt work pants, Carhartt bibs and jacket, and Carhartt work socks as they were special ordered). Couldn\\'t agree more, I did the Registered Apprentice Program or RAP in highschool got into an awesome trade (fire protection systems installer) and I haven\\'t looked back love every minute of it. Good for you dude. I\\'m 24 now and still getting into doing remodel work. I went to school for a couple years doing drafting and did that for four years and decided desk jobs are fucking lame when I don\\'t have any skills from the field. I wish I went right into a trade. I recently quit my job for a custom home builder because my boss was a dickhead but I learned so much from them and it really solidified this is what I want to do as a career. I work for a window and siding place now, finally spending some money on tools that aren\\'t garbage and I hope to one day go out on my own. Working with my hands is one decision in my life so far that really makes me happy. Guys like you often retire very wealthy. Awesome initiative, love to see it. I‚Äôve been wanting to join my local union but I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll screw up somehow. Atta boy! There have been some great pieces of advice given here, I mostly just want to say keep your chin up! I have lots of respect for an apprentice that wants to get his own tools (especially quality tools) and isn\\'t always asking to borrow stuff.\\n\\nI have lots more respect for an apprentice who is engaged, learning, and improving. The two often go hand in hand, bit sometimes there are guys that just seem to want the new shiny but don\\'t want to put in the work.\\n\\nThe industry needs guys like you, and if an asshole old timer gives you a hard time don\\'t let him get you down. Maybe there is something you need to learn from him. Maybe he\\'s a miserable asshole. Don\\'t dismiss criticism, and don\\'t let hurt feelings kill the joy of building cool shit. [deleted] You definitely spent some money on your set up. I just recently switched from dewalt tool to Milwaukee. I really like the Milwaukee m18. Congrats on your career choice! I start as a project engineer on June 1 and I\\'m similarly nervous. Just remember to ask questions and it\\'s much better to ask a question than to assume or pretend you know something. Everyone has been in your shoes and if you respect them, they will eventually respect you. It\\'s exciting to see young people in the field and seeing the benefits of hands on work. Coming from a guy who‚Äôs only experience with union‚Äôs is hearsay from friends... don‚Äôt sit on the opportunity to have representatives backing you every step of the way. Go for it. Nothing is easy in life, but you should always work smarter not harder. Unions are the smart move. I wish our school would have allowed hammers and saws. Nice job man. I highly recommend the Milwaukee packout system for your tools on site. Good start.. go get some experience though it‚Äôs all brand new? Label your shit it will be stolen or ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù soon enough Just wanna say, some people don\\'t like them but I\\'ve had my two stilettos for almost 20 years. They have been excellent. Although the texture is almost totally worn off my framer, still hits great. 15 years as an ironworker and seams ever year there are less younger people coming in. So that\\'s awesome your joining the trades and proud of it! Enjoy yourself and be proud of your work. Be safe have fun. Cheers mate good luck and work safely. There are always pluses and minuses to either route. Considering getting your construction management degree is not a bad option either. I\\'m in the industrial sector and lots of the tradespeople have been out of work in my area as crews were dramatically reduced in size when shutdowns were enacted where as me and other people I graduated with stayed employed the whole time. Neither is right or wrong, but it\\'s good to consider all possible scenarios. I‚Äôm 30 and I went the business school route, college and all that, it was boring. It‚Äôs worked out for me ok, but I often daydream about trying to secure a carpentry apprenticeship and really learning the trade beside hobby woodworking. Agreed. I‚Äôm 26 and I make more than my dad who‚Äôs an electrical engineering tech. He went to school and the whole bit. Trades are the way to go. And no student loans. I‚Äôm still paying for my 2 years of misguided partying. Good for you! I finished my commercial carpentry apprenticeship in 03. I‚Äôm now a superintendent making six figures. It‚Äôs a great career with a pretty high ceiling. There will be ups and downs but stick with it, it‚Äôs very rewarding! Milwaukee makes some decent tools.   Won‚Äôt take away from that.   \\n\\nBut consider switching brands.  Milwaukee and empire (amongst some others) are owned by a Chinese company.  It won‚Äôt take long for you to understand keeping money here when/where you can.  Dewalt is American owned and assembled.   Other brands are hit and miss. That‚Äôs the worst advice I‚Äôve ever ducking heard working for a living sucks I\\'d look into buying a Paslode gas nailer. Most larger pawnshops will have them available, or you can buy new for a pretty penny. Good luck out there. How is a picture of tools helpful or relevant? Why don\\'t you tell them about the 60+ hours a week you\\'ll have to work. The constant shuffling around of jobs and locations, getting rained out for days if not weeks at a time. Missing kids events. Being surrounded by a bunch of uneducated goons who\\'s operative word on the job site is \"Fuck\". Having to work in 90+ degree weather or subzero temperatures. \\n\\nYou don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, you just went to Home Depot... [deleted] This is fucking sweet Apparently they\\'re adding a separate services to put a artificial waterfall inside the quarry. Would be interesting to see this project when its finished. Need a big diving board Id imagine they bought the land for a really low price. I know homeowner\\'s insurance is higher if you have a pool, I can\\'t imagine what it would be like to underwrite this. I wonder, were they selling that land there? Or it‚Äôs possible to just pick a piece of land as long as it‚Äôs not a preservation and purchase it? [deleted] How fun for kids! That excavation must have been hell. Minecraft IRL. That be cool. Post some pics of the surroundings op. Any chances of uranium in the water?

Good luck exploring the infinite abyss. Yes. This is gonna be a top lister on Airbnb, haha. Hope they will have lots of mosquito screens. You live by the quarry? I live by the quarry too! We should hang out and throw things down it! Freakin awesome. Please post more pics if/when you can. Not really a mansion, looks like about 80\\'x30\\' walkout, or just under 5000 sq ft.

They need to be 100% tied off... lol mexican backhoe, but those look like filipinos Looks like some of the work in Los Angeles. As a sub, projects that are overly pushy on equipment certifications and daily safety reports are the worst. tf are equipment certifications? Someone put this to music right now. Revolutionary safety shoes [deleted] When you\\'re two days away from retirement... This can‚Äôt be good for the machinery. How will they stop? Ya, I‚Äôm going to need to see a safe work procedure. Looks like he‚Äôs using the rig as a push pole. We were just talking about safety in class today, and my instructor puts extreme stress on the importance of safety because and making sure the driver makes eye contact with you because if you don\\'t and you just running around the job site and not watching what you or others are doing, some terrible shit could happen. Lucky he didn\\'t get knocked out cold he had time to move too... Had to push someone out of the way of a telehandler from this exact situation one time.  Dude acted like I saved his life at the time I didn‚Äôt really understand how big of a deal it was when it happened I feel bad for the operator as well. The operator had responsibility in this situation, however I bet the person felt like a piece of shit after this incident. I guess they both learned something the hard way. This one happened so easily.  Not many good places to be in that exact instant.  I\\'m pretty careful around the equipment, but this reminds me to be even more careful. Gotta say that he was in the wrong spot there. That being said, if you\\'re driving a loader full of shit you might want to be on the lookout. 50/50 fault Way back, just out of high school, something like this happened to my buddy at a mill - he got knocked down by a [skidder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skidderdualfunction.jpg) and it rolled over/up his body starting at his feet, and it was just at his head before someone saw and got the driver to go forward off of him.\\n\\nHe lived, but he was all messed up for quite some time as you would imagine, even lost one of his eyes in the mishap. When i am operating equipment on a jobsite, I am constantly doing head counts to be sure I know where all my guys are. The force from the stop doesn‚Äôt break the teeth. The dado stack rotated and the teeth from one blade strike the teeth of the adjacent blade. Carbide is very brittle. Like an airbag deploying in a car, this is also expensive to repair once activated, but a small price to pay when you still have all fingers in place. And they sue anyone who tries to introduce similar safety devices.\\n\\nIt\\'s like the 3 point seat belt. Objectively a safe device that should be in every vehicle. Volvo patented it and recognizing its benefit to humanity they opened up the patent for other car manufacturers. Not asking Sawstop to give it away like Volvo did, but at least licensing it would be beneficial to all consumers. I didn\\'t realise it wrecked the blade, I knew about the brake mechanism though This guys going to have to use his miter saw for precision hot dog cutting in the future. It\\'s the only way to appease the picky 5 year old when making Kraft dinner with hot dogs casserole. Amazing technology on a really well designed and built saw. I used a cabinet version in a shop a few times and it was as nice as the delta or powermatic we also had. Just have to remember to bypass the sensor if you‚Äôre using some sopping wet PT lumber. Fingers saved. Shrapnel blinds user üò¨ Why would you dado a hot dog though? So how does the break work, do you have to release something or can this thing separate wood from salami? Why does the blade suddenly stop? Take my fingers but not the shirt. You should try that with your penis. My woodshop teacher in high school did this demo with us a few times. Crazy shit! It throws a block of aluminum into it and stops it cold. Everytime saw stop comes up I think the same thing: Safety gadgetry is neat, but nothing replaces safe shop practices. After a 5 minute tutorial on safe table saw usage no one should ever be in danger of hurting themselves.  \\n\\n\\nTLDR; don\\'t put your soft bits near the spinny stuff morons. The teeth broke because the brake squeezes the blade, or in this case blades, together. Most of the time the blade does not take any damage, just your ears from the gunshot sound of the brake being engaged. you are a day early MURICAAAAA WE DONT WAIT!!!! PARTY A WEEK STRAIGHT!!!!!

Cyclic loading deteriorating the bridge faster than originally expected without a midspan support (material fatigue)? that the west Seattle bridge? Heheh, too soon? this was 9 years ago, here you can see my \"handywork\" https://goo.gl/maps/kYHaN8GAHVanHWjUA\\n\\n\\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/WnKnvbt9EEJNXGGBA https://i.imgur.com/yomShHk.jpg  so thats the tensors we set up to avoid the V from opening plus a 1M  extra fundarion  reinforced with  carbon Fiber, now hodden with bushes Yes, while it was in the water. I did 3 columns on 2 different bents.\\n\\nLast year, we had a tropical storm come through my area. A barge company usually gets notified 4 hours in advance before a lake upstream releases the dam. This time, they called and said it was already released. The barge company had no time to secure their barges (this is the story I heard)\\n\\nWhat resulted was a barge drifting down stream while daisy chained to another and colliding with one bent. Another barge broke loose and hit another bent. \\n\\n\\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/y0IOidE) is why I had to repair/replace the columns. \\n\\nI‚Äôll get the finished product off of my work phone tomorrow. Dang it, I really wanted this to be a time lapse of the repairs. Looks good man. someone has to fix those fuck ups and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs someone with the diverse experience that it takes to put in a quality/safe product. offfff... amazed Who pours concrete from the top down. AKA Engineers on acid. Wow. The criminality of this industry. Just when I think it\\'s gonna be impossible to be more frustrated by humans, some sly fuck screws a city out of a functional bridge. Smell that? That\\'s the sweet miasma of corruption and selfishness. That looks like a ‚Äúfun‚Äù job,  these kind of emergency works pay better too, did the remaining colums hold while you worked, or did you have to lift the superstructure afterwards? Das ist gutes Zeug. [deleted] \"I\\'m sorry...we\\'re running into some problems, and this will take MUCH much longer than we anticipated\" Looks stunning! Where is it? Amazing Best part of these are usually avoiding the taxes Not in Philadelphia you don‚Äôt Had a couple of beachside jobs in San Diego. Definitely a nice little perk If you hadn\\'t included your plank in the video, I would have called BS..... Man, I\\'m looking at the forecast for the next week and I want with every fiber of my being to tell you to fuck off.\\n\\nBut I won\\'t, because that might ruin your view, and that view is gorgeous as helllllll. Any jobs going mate? Amazing view!! But wearing my bags and working my ass off all day in that kind of hot humid climate sounds more like a nightmare than Paradise to me. A lifeline with a safety belt would be recommended for a job like that. This is literally every day in Florida. Huh, strange. This has never happened to me. Idiot or genius? Atleast he had his hardhat on. r/osha He knocked out a human sized hole so the ceiling could safely collapse around him. Genius. Safety third! wow... I need this, the mortar of my ceiling is coming down. Need to replace all of it. Any ideas? Haha  you could still read it couldn‚Äôt you?  Everyone always overthinking shit. I do masonry for a living been around it all my life my name is mason my dads a mason grandpa was and great grandpa. You all are some pussies man. Bolster skills right there gentlemenüëå I\\'m going to show this to my guys when I show up to site, and none of them are wearing their fucking safety glasses. I prefer a face shield for metal grinding or cutting.  Damn.  After seeing stuff like this, people should realize they need to wear *more* than just safety glasses.  That shrapnel was less than an inch away from skin.  Throw the full face shield on too.   I love PPE ‚ù§ And that‚Äôs why we make sure our glasses are Z87 rated at a minimum. If this was a pair of gas station sunglasses, that lens would have shattered and his eye would be toast.  Pooped em Your supposed to wear a face shield when using a grinder People at my job just make sure to squint.  What brand of wheel? Man, I fucking hate cutting wheels. I always try to wear a full face if I can, and I always let the tool do it\\'s thing instead of forcing it. But those fucking thing shatter all the time. Had one that broke and shot up and stuck in a wood beam on my shop ceiling. Every time I\\'d see someone using it with out the shield I\\'d ask them what the fuck they are doing and point up at the cieling. It was usually a new person. Damn I am literally about to use metal cutting 4 1/2 inch grinder.  I am definitely wearing glasses and gloves.  Crazy you would have for sure lost an eye if not for glasses. We had Hilton buy one of our aging hotels in my small hometown for a remodel.  Every other hotel is privately owned.  When the job started, random tradesmen would show up to do work.  There were cases where the general was paying cash for these dudes doing journeymen work.  When Hilton caught wind of it, they built a plywood retaining wall arund the entire property and hired security guards 24/7.  Entering the site was like entering a military base on lockdown.  A buddy of mines whos a delivery driver said they searched and checked off invoices to make sure everything was accounted for.  On the way out, they checked to make sure you werent taking material off property. So how did this happen? use safe work practices and you have nothing to worry about Whenever I\\'m using a metal wheel (particularly thin cutting) I break out the face shield...\\n\\nWould the \"play\" in the face shield (It can move as a whole closer to my face) make a difference in the penetration depth of the shrapnel? \\n\\nI can imagine the \"play\" in the shield absorbing a fair % of the kinetic force particularly because I\\'d the area spread. Therebye decreasing the force available to penetrate...\\n\\n(Think shooting an arrow at a loosely hanging peice of leather compared to a piece with backing) \\n\\nOr am I completely wrong... yeah I don\\'r fuck with cutoff blades.  I\\'ve had them come apart on me too many times.  I believe people with imperfect eyesight are at an advantage over those of us with 2020 because they will always be wearing glasses, most of which offer some protection over none at all.  My advice is to buy some nice acrylic transition lens glasses that you\\'d be comfortable wearing all the time.  Why transition lenses?  because every time you take off your goggles to put on sunglasses, (like say on break) you are at a risk of losing your safety glasses and/or not putting them back on when you get back to work, or are otherwise in a situation that is too dark for sunglasses while working. Plot twist his glasses were in his breast pocket,, Wheel was aiming for that horrible chin hair  He wasn‚Äôt he had his glasses on lol This is why osha exists  I get that this happens but I am kind of doubtful on this one. \\n\\nI find it pretty hard to believe that the fragment wouldn‚Äôt deflect off of the glasses since they are convex. That plus they would show signs of cracking from the impact. I just don‚Äôt think a grinding wheel is sharp enough to puncture treated plastic at an angle like that. \\n\\nI would be he ground the glasses out and stuck the piece in there.   I‚Äôll put my cheesy dad-joke hat on and see if any of these meet your needs...\\n\\n‚ÄúLook out Pardner! Construction Area!‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúSorry for our BIG mess!

Please be respectful on site. No catcalls of our workers Also- All the mandated and necessary safety, notification, and way finding signage is up- this would be purely for good humor and fun- My boss said that Rome job would have been done sooner if he had been the foreman. So a large majority of our work comes from rehabbing assisted living facilities. Our superintendent is now responsible for taking the temperature of every laborer or subcontractor that walks onto the property each and every day I\\'d be curious what the procedure for taking the temp is. \\n\\nIt\\'s not like any of us has (or at least 99% of us) have any kind of training in infection control when it comes to cleaning a thermometer.\\n\\nIf it were me, I\\'d just be aiming my laser temp gauge in the general direction of the dude\\'s mouth. Make sure you fill out your name so you can be blamed if something happens!! Didn\\'t they say that 80% of people didn\\'t show any symptoms? How much medical training did they give you? As someone in HR, yikes.  I hope your company got their HR and Legal teams together to prepare for when this eventually goes to court.  Everything I\\'ve read says that if a pandemic were officially declared, this would be suitable, but until then this is the huge legal risk. Where u working at? I‚Äôm really glad we don‚Äôt work for the local hospitals or on their properties anymore. Wow, I hadn‚Äôt even thought of that requirement from a client. What about the flu?\\nAlso does your company supply vacation/sick days or health insurance? We get vacation days we can use as sick days and we have company health insurance. My foreman got tested today, came to work on monday after a skiing trip to Austria and didn\\'t feel well the stupid fuck. \\nAtleast two weeks paid leave isn\\'t the worst that could happen ; ). Hahahahaha. That sucks. Everyone is going to hate you. Apprentice friend of mine on a hospital job going through the same thing all last week and for the foreseeable future That‚Äôs pretty hardcore but I understand, the diversity of people on my job is vast but we haven‚Äôt gone to that extreme yet. The owner of a skilled care facility rehab project we are working on is requiring something similar. Sounds like a pain to manage from a field side. I also work for a GC that does a lot of senior living/hospital work. There are rumors that this is going to be happening for us soon as well. Where are you located if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? I tried to call out of work two weeks ago because of flu-like symptoms.  My boss was like ‚ÄúAwh damn dude ‚Äî I mean, I‚Äôve been sick too man and *im* still here, sooooo I mean like your not going to be in trouble but we‚Äôre pouring concrete today man we need the help‚Äù. So I went in and reluctantly ran the chute for 25 fuckin yards.  \\n\\nI have never felt so fucking sick and tired than when I got home after that shit.  \\n\\nTLDR:  my company doesn‚Äôt give a god damn if u have coronavirus u better be there or u can go work at Wendy‚Äôs. No doubt my project gets shut down soon. The school told all the kids to go home this weekend for the rest of the semester.  Where is this happening? Please. Too bad by the time you\\'re noticing symptoms you\\'ve already spread the disease Sheesh... I definitely sympathize with the guy who has to now manage this additional paperwork with all the other stuff. Laborers and journeyman can\\'t complain to much as it\\'s only 5 minutes out of they day, which safety meetings take as long if not longer. Wtf. World going insane They are starting to screen people for the hospital i work in as a contract plumber.. i feel sorry for you, so assuming one of these guys are sick, we\\'ll have to assume you are too! Godspeed my friend Oh wow, you got a medical degree AND work in construction?!\\n\\nCause I mean ...only doctors can decide who is healthy enough to go to work...right? Make sure you give them all a proper hand shake too First step of creating an official looking company form: use Microsoft Word default font. Tried ones, was fired from that morgue Safety orientation stickers mean a lot to me. They\\'re not actual souvenirs, but I\\'m proud of all of them on my hardhat. I‚Äôve got a stack of milk crates in my basement with old ass bottles, bricks with local defunct company names on them, a bunch of different rock specimens, horseshoes... hmmm what else have we dug up. Railroad spikes galore, there‚Äôs a ton of old trainyards around here. \\n\\nWe‚Äôve found trucks and tractors that farmers have burned and buried decades ago, but I didn‚Äôt toss those in the back of my truck to take home. Haha. \\n\\nAs for other stuff like cores, if it‚Äôs a particularly clean core, I‚Äôll cut and grind it, polish it, seal it, and bam! Paperweights for Christmas gifts to different contractors. Haha \\n\\nOh shit, almost forgot. My fianc√© reminded me of job I did at an old distillery. We were sawcutting out parts of the slab to put new plumbing in, and one section fell through to a hollow. There was a wooden footlocker buried that had rotted through full of prohibition-era booze. That was so fucking cool. \\n\\nAnd my dude had a ceiling collapse on him in a restoration project. After brushing the plaster and dust off him, he looked down and saw bits of a skeleton, screamed at the top of his lungs and bolted out of the building. Haha. Building got shut down for the day by police, turned out to be a medical reconstruction or whatever. So I think he‚Äôs found the coolest shit: a literal human skeleton. Haha The guy who I apprenticed under, would take panties from the homes we were in.....weirdo Parking tickets, mostly. Yeah but nothing that big haha. I\\'ve taken home cool hardware or free tools from each job I\\'ve been on You must repair bridges, me too Not on purpose, but every time I switch to a newer vehicle I clean out the old one and find all kinds of them. \\n\\n\"That piece of siding is from the daycare where I accidentally taught the kids bad words\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a piece of trim from the bathroom where the homeowner wanted the paint to be the same color as the green rock\"\\n\\n\"Oops. That\\'s the hammer tacker D was looking for last week!\" I keep marbles, or bearings...sounds weird, but damn every job i do, i find a marble, or something similar to one I kept a broken off tooth from a geo pier rig. Too bad it looks like a giant metal dildo on my desk.  Nice collection.. cores have cool aggregate..  I scored a solid lead water pipe last month off a demo- rebuild we‚Äôre on in NYC I have a piece of granite brick that got sawed through during an urban job, they hit some very old walk and foundation as they started removals for a widened road.\\n\\nWould\\'ve kept a piece of the streetcar rail they dug up on a lakeside project if I could\\'ve gotten a piece small enough, that line was built in 1887.\\n\\nAside from that, just the occasional bit of aggregate that\\'s particularly interesting one way or another. I cut dyed cylinders and make coasters out of them After I polish them up a bit. I have a collection of hard hats. I keep cores too!! I used to keep permit cards as kind of a running kill display. Thought core samples always looked pretty cool. All the tools I can manage to sneak out I have some sections of the Baltimore light rail, about an inch thick, that I use as book ends. Ahhhhh, that looks like some nice 58/28. Perhaps 19mm stone there? I used to keep excess paint, my old boss would always over order paint for jobsites. So I got to paint my whole apartment for free, and later the new house we moved into. I used to save cores. My ex wife hated it.  Had to chuck em out. Hey I saved the concrete cores for the electrical pipes that were taken from the foundation on the house we are building. I have no idea what to do with them I just figured this was probably the last house I\\'m going to build for myself so I kept them. When I was in commercial I used to get a ton of material that I installed at home. Stickers too for sure. Nowadays not really, but cool things always arise once in a while Yep. All kinds of crazy ones sitting around the office. Yeah every week I save some of their money What\\'s up with those cores being so dark? Never seen unpigmented concrete so dark Only old newspapers or Coke bottles. Why didn\\'t the bucket raise from the ground  Clean site is a safe site Shop brooms work best when pulling them.  Asked a laborer to sweep a stair tower a few years ago.  He started at the bottom.  \\n\\nThat was his last day. Wait what\\'s wrong with his brooming? I\\'m not going to tell him he\\'s doing it wrong.  He\\'s from Krypton, that\\'s how they work the brooms there. They will find ways to label all construction as \"essential\" because construction = good economy. Don\\'t expect the higher ups to take care of us. WE have to take care of each other on the job site and most importantly look after yourself. Forgot to mention we have about 50 people on site I‚Äôm sitting here right now thinking how pointless it is as a construction worker to try to keep the virus off my hands when working.   I touch so many different surfaces and I am in areas where so many people have been I feel like I would go through a gallon a day.   At this point I have sadly resolved myself to the fact that I will get it while working. Our site shut down for quarantine. Normally for other people it‚Äôs 14 days. For our site it was three. But don‚Äôt worry they brought in 4 extra wash stations. Take that corona. All the office people are home though. Wouldn‚Äôt want them to have to slum it like us blue collars We call those pink eye dispensers :-/ We started building our own with small hot water heaters and a basin. We‚Äôve set up about 30 throughout the Bay Area. Not a hard solution and all the materials are readily available at HD. I came here to say thank you for all the hard work that you guys do.  Please stay safe and healthy. Just ordered 2 of those and 2 hand sanitizer stations for my project with no more than 3 small crews working at a time. Hopefully we are good My GC took the bag of sanitizer rrom our biffy for his personal use. Cannot wait for our governor to declare a stay at home. [removed] if anything,.dont touch your face Just piss on your hands, the ammonia in urine is a better sanitizer anyway. I\\'m in charge of a site with 20+- crew non union. I spray the restrooms and commonly touched surfaces 3 times daily with a 10% sodium hypochlorite solution daily. I check all personnel daily for fevers. I have also personally invested in face shields for the labors who jump in the trenches with close contact. This is utter bullshit that others are not taking these precautions. We are blessed to work and we have to protect our subs, vendors, and our employees. Figuring this virus lives a very long time on plastic.   This is a horrible device that should be taken away. Building a data center for hospital, they‚Äôre making us wear masks and stay at least 6ft apart, how tf are two guys supposed to do that on a skyjack lmao, and I‚Äôd wear a damn mask if I could find them, sold out everywhere. Hell me and my buddy even had to get temp checked this morning, we weren‚Äôt even working in the main building, this shits so dumb We dont even have a handwashing station and I\\'m in NYS. fuck the GC and the company which owns the building. I\\'m sure they could get one, they are too fucking lazy. ü§¨ Most likely there are already 5 million people infected in the US since January. Where‚Äôs your job? I‚Äôll take it. We had to rig a water cooler to operate by pedal. Actually works fairly proficiently. I did add an additional toilet. We aren‚Äôt running many guys but I wanted to make sure we never ran out of sanitizer, and the companies won‚Äôt sell you them separate right now. I always put a sliver of a chlorine tablet in ours ;) I was just at an maintenance outage for a paper mill with thousands of workers and the hand washing station I went to ran out of hand sanitizer or soap so they put out body wash to use instead GC here. We will be getting hand washing stations at our site soon due to people stealing hand sanitizer in the porta johns. Also our porta johns servicing company is no longer able to receive any more hand sanitizer from their distributer.. \\n\\nAny suggestions for good hand washing stations?? I had all my sites plumb in a laundry sink and ordered motion faucets The governments can be stupid cause they have no clue that your average jobsite are filthy and unsanitary. But what do they know there heads up each other\\'s asses in the office. Am I missing something?\\n\\nI mean... for 50 guys you should have more than one probably... but if it\\'s kept stocked with soap and towels and there\\'s a trashcan nearby... what\\'s the problem? You guys need to give up on this mandatory and possibly paid two weeks off shit.  It‚Äôs never going to happen.  I mean fuck, Jefe wants us back by Easter.  Now the management is just going to want us to work on Easter too.  Just give up on the whole ‚Äúhaving time off to enjoy your life‚Äù thing lmao. This is at the north end of a bridge.  The setback from the onramp reduces its footprint.  Once it‚Äôs high enough, the setback doesn‚Äôt apply anymore That\\'s an architectural marvel. Amazing. I have an irrational fear of cantilevers. I couldn‚Äôt go up there. This is a BIG project, right?   If I recall correctly, this is the angle that makes it look the most unsupported. I love this, this is the kinda stuff i want to work on Can you send me more pictures? I\\'m really interested in this. This is in Vancouver? That is the dumbest fucking building I\\'ve ever seen, mostly because of the fact that it\\'s built in an area that is due for a 9.0+ earthquake any day now. This is a death trap. Who the hell approved this?! Does this have a core or exoskeleton? You should see some of the suites... It‚Äôs like they stole the design for TELUS Sky and flipped it on its top. Looks like Cookie Monster got hungry. Pushing the boundaries on psychological comfort Is something like this earthquake safe? It looks cool but it‚Äôs also sort of unsettling in a strange way. My brain seems to not like things that don‚Äôt seem sturdy (although I‚Äôm sure it is). Any idea how much a normal room would cost? AmazedüôÇ Fuck that I like it Tell us more about how you cut it. Jesus christ that could flatten someone. I trust you guys were safe, I\\'m just saying hot damn. that mud blast has to sting. your coworker wasn\\'t ready for it lol Now you have a nice patio to go with the window. That\\'s pretty freakin\\' sweet What‚Äôs gonna go in the hole? Is that a skate ramp? The man appears really small for some reason How long did it take to cut it with a 4‚Äô steel bar? Dude on the inside\\'s not named [Stanley](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.llworldtour.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F04%2Fflatstanley-book.gif&f=1&nofb=1) by any chance is he ? What kept the concrete from falling back on the worker? Why not a diamond, rope saw? my ears hurt watching this. wear earplugs guys Ceeeeaaaaaaaaassssssssaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought he was going to dab How did you move that out of there? They\\'re just un-earthing a Steely Mammoth. Pretty rare but global warming is thawing them out. [deleted] I\\'d like to see the sequence of works that goes into the recovery. Hope nobody was hurt and the driver escaped safely.\\nAny chance of an update? Looks cold. Oooh, damn.  Did they get the machine out of the hole before it froze? \\n\\nMy dad and brother got their D8 Cat stuck in a slough in one of their fields in the middle of the winter. They made the mistake of letting it sit there overnight.  They tried using 5 tractors to get it out.  Nope.  It was frozen solid until spring.\\n\\nHowever, that doesn\\'t match the one that my husband\\'s cousin got involved in.  You might have heard of it, since his buddy wrote a [song](https://youtu.be/QCcWzLAcv4o) about it.  Shaddy will never live it down. Fuck Drag it out and wash it off. Hopefully the seat heater is ok! If should be fine. Just yank it out with a bigger excavator and let it dry out. Just put it in rice The things he needs to get that thing out are in this picture. Got my scag stuck in a hole the other day, thought I had it bad.\\n\\nWhat kind of damage is to be expected after this? Would the engine pull in all that mud? Hopefully the friend in the back can pull it out. I hope he got that damage waiver How much does it cost to rent one of those for the time at the job site? Hopefully they got the upgraded insurance package üò¨ A few people should be fired over this. How ridiculous. Hope everyone‚Äôs okay. yup, looks like a bad day O dang\\n\\nRecord the rescue!\\n\\nI hope y‚Äôall get it out without having to call in some serious military grade rescue equipment. TheGreatWar.png Halp One time we had a contractor get a  dozen stuck in the swamp, we left it over night and when returned the next day it had sank up to the roof. Mistakes were made... At first glance it looked stuck in concrete. Any chance this is a mortenson site? I say blame the geotech (assuming you had one). Let\\'s be real, the pic was clearly staged. Everyone knows that management doesn\\'t check jobs in bad weather.... You\\'ll freeze before you make it to the first Porta John.  I miss working outside, so you guys/gals can stuff it.  My labia was warm and not sticking to anything. I\\'m laughing in Montana with 9 inches, at least I\\'m not in Bozeman.  *laughs in South Florida* Brick layers are in desperate need in ottawa. Labour too Ugh. Got 12\" here in Virginia today. Gonna have to go in early and shovel off the sidewalks and lay some sand down so the subs don\\'t bitch about it being unsafe. That and so they don\\'t carry in 20# of snow each because none of them give a shit about anything.  Spent last winter framing in the mountains in Utah, spending this winter as a super. My truck is warm and me likey.... Hah, its only 52 in Houston. Inside a home with the heat on. My subs are loving it. We are all in short sleeves. But damn if that porta can isn\\'t 20 below inside. \\n\\nI\\'m on an inside job w/heat until spring ...... and then the AC comes on for the balance of the job. [deleted] Looks a hell of a lot funner than the 8\" concrete wall slabs we cut out of a 12 story building for balconies..... with active train tracks on either side. That part is fun, but everything before that isn\\'t On a side note I LOVE scissor lifts.\\n\\nI‚Äôm a construction manager and I had never driven one before and needed one for a last minute job before handover. I was able to borrow one but there was no one qualified to drive it so I took a risk.\\n\\nSo much fun. Bricklayer here: when you tip those over, try not to rock it. Just push and keep pushing, otherwise it may come down on your side and being on a scissor lift with 3 people is not gonna end well if that happens. Have fun, but be safe! Really fun...until the cleanup. Unless you have a heavy machine to clean up. In that case WICKED fun!!! Great work! What amazes me is that the steel reinforcement extends only a few inches onto the bricks. Is this normal? I did this on a whole slate on an old house we rehabilitated ,  we had to cut 1sqm  at a time, and lower it with chains [https://imgur.com/a/KsEIDts](https://imgur.com/a/KsEIDts) What\\'s more fun is doing it manually This seems very safe Bro you might want to invest in this \\n\\nhttps://www.makitatools.com/products/details/DCM501Z Highly flammable compressed gas in a small enclosed environment with limited ventilation, what could go wrong? The law says no phone while driving... doesn\\'t say shit about making coffee! Props bro!  Your my kinda fella!  I‚Äôll bring creamer and more coffee! How about just do this on the tailgate when you pull up to the job site instead of bathing in CO? What could possible go wrong with that!? üòÜ Y\\'all are being unreasonable.... OP is the site safety man. Forgot to ask, is that an old percolator? Looks like it\\'s well broken in. I was convinced I had walked into r/idiotsincars Well this will surely only improve the smell of that pickup I work for a telecommunications company and one of our divisions does prewires for apartment buildings. One of the techs on that crew does just this for cooking all his meals and his coffee, he just does it on the tailgate instead of the cab. Try the yellow tank. Makita makes a decent battery powered coffee maker Makita makes a cordless one....about the only good makita Jesus Christ. You remind me of my brother, the guy who insists on throwing gas on fires and barbecuing in our small enclosed porch. Oh calm down lads. That‚Äôs badass. Pouring concrete in 91 degree heat. Fuck anything hot today. You guys all need fo fucking relax a little, jesus christ for some reason i find these tiny, speedy men fascinating and wish we had video of the whole thing I‚Äôm impressed that it‚Äôs going directly on to the truck.  Nice efficiency there No rails or harness. It\\'s why A frame is outdated. There\\'s not many safe ways to erect/dismantle. Like ants. \\n\\nWe just use skid pans and cranes. Crazy how many pieces it is I‚Äôll try to make a longer time lapse when they take down the other side. r/gifsthatendtoosoon No harness PPE? \\nFuck that shit. Scaffolding is kind of fun to work with. Read title, clicked without checking if /r/Construction or /r/CatastrophicFailure\\n\\nHad great suspense.  Was not disappoint. I did this job for a couple years in twenties, was pretty fun. I got really fit from doing it, along with hitting the gym. \\n\\nIf you get on an awesome crew you can get stuff done fast. Pretty impressive. I like the guy who shows up at the end in the window, and is like: yup they are still working.. It\\'s kind of like watching ants work. Haha cool video thanks for sharing! I am really glad I don\\'t have to walk on that shit very often. /r/OSHA As long as the sings are up we are protected. I just threw a 20 litre container in the car for personal water, hand sanitizer, soap in a bottle, gloves, respirator, overalls. \\n\\nOne of those things you might want to get into if you don\\'t do it already is to strip down outside the house at the end of the day and jump straight into the shower, it is all good being clean as you can on site but if we are dragging it back into our homes at the end of the day mitigating the risk is just an exercise in compliance rather than treating it like the risk it actually is. My favourite is, ‚ÄúOk guys, everyone sign the covid sheet saying your not sick.‚Äù And then 10 guys pass around a piece of paper and a pen to sign it Call OSHA dude. There are guidelines. If the contractors can\\'t cant abide by them, they don\\'t need the project done. \"Oh look, we\\'ll use this puddle over here\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you guys have water bottles right?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll provide you with one hand sanitizer to share between the twelve of you. Use it sparingly!\" It‚Äôs JEDunn. What do you expect Our company went out and secured supply of 4x 5 liter alcohol based hand sanitizers for all our sites (around 30), and then realized they don‚Äôt have the foamy dispenser thing to make it work with the special tubs. They are on back order for another 6 weeks, thus why they were able to secure the refill cartridges.... I am a structural PM.  We are currently working for a GC that is providing multiple hand wash stations, installed hand sanitizer stations at all job and lunch trailers, limiting one persons to a vehicle or lift and checking all coming to the site in the morning for anyone with a fever, cough, runny nose. Stay Home if your not healthy.  Everyone is serious about physical distancing. If we can follow some simple things and really follow our local health departments, I think we can all keep working in an industry we all love to be working in. I can just imagine the bravado on site.\\n\\nJust wait a few weeks when everyone around starts getting infected. Wont be long till the sites stut down. On the only big construction site I was ever on, the entire safety program, which appeared vast, was merely a lawsuit mitigation program. This doesn\\'t surprise me in the least. (I realize my experience is by no means necessarily the norm. I went out today to get small hand soap bottles from Ollies to put on each truck. \\nWill probably get a 3-5 gallon cooler per truck and fill them every day for hand wash stations. 100% gloves, 100% of the time brah We are not disposable. We have the same signs on our jobsites. I had to put up about 50 of them...C.Y.A. purposes. For guys using the sign in sheet, what I\\'m doing is getting the foreman of each crew to fill it out with their guy\\'s info on it then having them send me a picture of it to add to the electronic daily. That way only 1 guy is touching it. \\n\\nI feel for you guys that are currently vertical and inside. Not sure I\\'d care to stick around in those conditions. Fuckin Je Dunn.. üòÇüòÇ You must have taken a pic at one of my sites. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen water at a construction site That\\'s always a problem. I work for a telecom company and we have done several jobs pre-wiring apartment buildings. One of the techs carries a jerry can of water in his truck for washing his hands. I think if I was in the field I\\'d do the same thing. I don\\'t understand how can a work site not have places for people to wash hands, they must have toilets on site for people to use right? Job site I left yesterday had a shelf nailed to the outside of the building, with a bottle of softsoap and no water, with the words \"sanitary station\" written in sharpie.\\n\\nThat\\'s all it took to meet the guidelines for \"safe work practices\" in the state of MA. We build Lighting and Data systems for Highways in Virginia. We‚Äôre still working and glad to have the work. We have 30+ crews in Northern Va and Southern Va  maybe 5 crews. Bring your own water and food to work and bring and attitude of gratefulness for being able to work another week and earn a living for our families. True. We‚Äôve never seen this before.we get 40 cases of bottled water a wk and good ppe. I don‚Äôt think we can fool ourselves about exposer. I get undressed in my garage and leave my gear in my service truck. I have 2 kids at home an my wife.\\nI have 4 wks vacation but unemployment won‚Äôt cover my salary. If it goes another2 months it‚Äôll be a radical change for this country I‚Äôm afraid. It\\'s called a stand pipe for a reason Their are dark corners of our infrastructure where no lift can get under and no ladder can reach.  You‚Äôre welcome. I appreciate the man in the corner just staring at the wall. He\\'s already put himself in a time out. He knows what he did. I‚Äôm on a county jail job right now where our scope is to install firestop spray at the top of 10,000 lf of interior CMU. The only problem is that all HVAC is already installed. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to fit up there. At least his chain is latched Come on over to /r/osha I don\\'t know which part of this picture I hate more, the HVAC guy on the ~~fire sprinkler~~ pipe or the oblivious pinch point guy. Progress is progress yo You\\'re not my mom, I do what I want! Hate to say it, but I‚Äôve been there lol &#x200B;\\n\\nWhat happened when you approached and confronted the chap with your recommendation that ya\\'ll shall all agree not to do this? Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. He has enough shit there to grab on to for balance.\\n\\nI\\'d be more concerned about the fella squeezing between the mewp and the wall. That could be messy if the mewp moves. Agreed, squeezing between the wall and a lift is dangerous. Not the worst violation I\\'ve seen. Should have a harness on though. While there\\'s not really a clear path to fall through to the ground, shit happens. Of course there\\'s probably nothing approved to tie off to above him or around him. What trade is this clown? That is a cast iron dwv no-hub pipe. One extra once of weight over it\\'s PSI capacity would snap that pipe like a twig and this guy will be a victim of gravitational forces... Ha agree to which the idiot standing on the pipe above the lift or the other idiot about to get crushed with the scissor....ok I\\'ll agree to both lmao where is safety dave when you need him Guys that take pictures like this have never worked in the field and it shows. Too late, someone already did it.\\n\\nThis has now become SOP Is this polident job at gsk? Creeped out by the albino fella on the left haha It‚Äôs got a few hangers on it, not seeing the problem here^^ Nothing to see here, the safety chain is latched. Oh man that\\'s like the entirety of my job. I\\'m 5\\'3\" AKA perfectly sized to use the lift enough to then climb the ductwork and sprinkler pipes and various other trades stuff like a monkey. Ok I will never stand facing a corner doing nothing. I don‚Äôt get how the dude is gonna get crushed. Does it look like the guy in the lift can get the controls quickly. Plus knowing the said idiot I‚Äôm sure he made eye contact and asked to pass by. Not saying the metalcraft dude isn‚Äôt retarded though because they are terrible to work with and probably would come down without a warning. Why not just raise the lift up? Separates the boys from the men [deleted] At times I will do stupid shit like this. I weigh about 130lbs. So I can get away with this from time to time. At least he wasn\\'t standing on PEX or PVC. His choices were bad, but at the same time good. He knowest the hangers was right there, so any experienced worker knows that those hangers can support some weight. Still, a bad idea. Lmao! I mean- technically he is probably not 5‚Äô above the lower lever(deck of scissor). Not gonna try to argue that one with osha. God I hope those welds don‚Äôt hold up. Some ppl unfortunately have to learn the hard way Nah if you\\'re a contractor all you have to do is load it however you want and then slap the side and say \"she\\'ll ride.\" At least that\\'s how my boss does it... Don\\'t tow with a Mustang. Got it. If you ever get in a situation hammer down baby and pull the trailer straight This happened to me, all you have to do is get what you\\'re towing to collide into the side of your vehicle like a real jack knife and it\\'ll correct back to normal no problem. A sway control system really helps too. Every driver that plans on using any size trailer should have to learn this.. One contractor i knew would overload his trailer and would block up the leaf springs with wood blocks so it would still roll, totally safe right? Problem is here in SoCal, as elsewhere im sure, lots of contractors are using 1/2 ton trucks and pulling trailers with pallets of bricks, concrete,  tile, dirt, small equipment,  lumber and the load it neutral because their trucks cant take the weight. That‚Äôs common knowledge... don‚Äôt put all the weight on the tongue or the back of the trailer, spread it as even as possible. Do people just not know about weight distributing hitches or do they not care? Ship my pants? Safety Guy Protocol:\\n1. See hazard.\\n2. Take picture\\n3. Say nothing to foreman/Supt\\n4. Turn photo in to office and let the shit roll downhill.\\n\\nAll while Supt stands at the bottom of the hill continuously eating pile after pile of shit. I\\'ve honestly never had a safety guy like that. All the GC\\'s we work with have safety guys that basically make you fix it on the spot or they wont leave. Super chill about it though. They have no problems passing out fresh safety glasses or gloves which is pretty awesome. Ya\\'ll need better safety people. Borderline negligence that will get someone hurt or killed. They all care more about surface level compliance than actual safety. And usually the safety man is doing something unsafe while he\\'s taking a picture of you doing something unsafe. I\\n\\nI had a safety guy call me once because one of my guys was on top of something and was not tied off. One of my guys then sends me a picture of the safety guy on top of something higher than they were, so he could take the picture of them and you could see he wasn\\'t even tied off himself. Safety people need to respect the chain of command, but they\\'re also inspectors. Unless it\\'s an immediate hazard, they should follow the chain of command. If they do insert themselves in the field and in the moment, they should address the foreman unless there\\'s an imminent threat to life and limb. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an unsafe method‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat do you recommend changing?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúMy insurance doesn‚Äôt allow me to instruct you.‚Äù The site I‚Äôm on has diesel excavators running indoors with no ventilation and plenty of masonry dust floating around but I get yelled at for taking my safety glasses off to land wires in outlets As a safety I guy i take a picture, point it out to the foreman to fix it or take the time to fix it my self. Load it into our company‚Äôs software to document to prevent it from happening again. If it‚Äôs imminent danger you stop the work. Most of the time nobody gets upset. You‚Äôd get fired taking a photo and not doing anything where I work. My safety folks will shut you down if you so much as fart upwind from them. on sites i have worked on if you arent there the day they choose the site safety super for the workers that is now your job.   always hated having to go around with the ministry and the developers safety person though cause then i would have to go around and tell all the trades to fix their shit or we will get shut down.   amazing how fast people disappear when the ministry shows up God laborers truly can find a way to fuck up literally anything I laughed so hard I hate to say it but this has happened to me. Felt like I pinched my dick off.  I did not report it as an injury. Literally laughing out loud. Just wait until you get the workman‚Äôs comp paperwork. Hahahahahaha Worst game of ‚Äújust the tip‚Äù ever! Should have had him fill out ‚Äúwhat would have prevented the injury?‚Äù Haha My company sends out a quarterly safety bulletin and publishes accidents/injuries and lessons learned. I would love nothing more than to see this in there. I know I‚Äôm unpopular here but this is the exact reason I stand to wipe my ass Shouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äúwipping‚Äù his own ass to begin with. ...soooo I‚Äôm a contractor and my own toilet seat is just clipped on to the previous screws because I‚Äôm lazy and when I have guests over I have to warn them of this possibility. Sometimes, I hear a loud as crash and ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù from the bathroom and I chuckle to myself. That‚Äôs fucking amazing hahaha Hell yeah that\\'s a real injury I bet that hurt! Am I the only one that holds my junk away from the toilet when taking a dump in public? Even when I wipe I keep my hand down. It\\'s difficult but worth it. My uncles a welder and his jobsite doesn\\'t cover cost for \"useless appendages\" in other words your penis That‚Äôs a new All site safety/toolbox talk meeting topic. ‚ÄúKeeping your dick tip safe while in the portajon‚Äù There\\'s a workmans comp claim that id like to see. r/funny Have only had to use it once. Thought it was so sweet. My super wanted to use one for everything after that haha Not the crane - but the spider lift work platforms - as an arborist we get called occasionally for trees that cant be felled, are too unsafe to climb, in locations that are not accessible to a traditional bucket truck, or are tall enough that a 60\\' bucket truck isnt sufficient.  I absolutely love them.  They increase productivity, and when used properly, increase safety massively. No and that‚Äôs badass I never even knew they existed haha No but seen them in sf. Theyd shake the whole building so bad when they moved youd have to reset all the lasers, laying out youd just have to wait till they moved. Badass watching them though Several of these machines can fit through a standard door way. Very cool machines. Havnt gotten a job running them yet tho We use something similar for Glasswork. Mini crane with powered suction cups for hoisting big heavy panes of glass. Quite a handy machine Wtf is this witchcraft???? Saw one for the first time about a month ago. Didn\\'t know what it was called, but thought that it would be prudent to call it a spider crane due to its looks despite only having 4 legs. I\\'m a bit surprised to read all of these comments. \\nI work in commercial construction and these units are always on the job for ironworkers and glaziers.\\n\\nGet the right tools to make your job safe. If you can\\'t lift something, a machine can. I used one with a basket on the end for me. They are cool. Some painting jobs you need em. Is this job in L.A.? Cool crane. Never seen one like that. Seems really versatile. \\n\\nBTW that‚Äôs a crazy bump in the cable tray. Im curious what this was used for? Like what inside of a building is so heavy you need this for? It doesn‚Äôt look like it has a bunch of counterweight. Is it limited in reach/capacity? Seen a few of these around on some taller buildings, along with the Jecko. I think that\\'s what they are called. It\\'s a mini crane like the Spyder but the outriggers are different,  heavier boom. Used a bigger one of these to install a monumental stair late in a project in FL.  Really cool and 100x easier than chainfalling all the pieces. Spider cranes and spider lifts are one of the ultimate tools, I get to use the lifts pretty regularly. I used one to set beams in elevator shafts on a job a couple of years ago. They‚Äôre good machines and easy to move around into tight spots. I‚Äôm getting one delivered to my site next Tuesday. Pretty stoked, not gunna lie Cool. More than I expected. There‚Äôs a mom joke in there somewhere. [What the hell is even that](https://youtu.be/J_zr-Qk6wh0) I was on a job recently were the iron workers were using one. It looked like it would be fun to operate. DOC OC Yeah but not to go 10‚Äô Not the crane but the [concrete pump versions ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LkyQHmdaDGNo9ht692u-2POlfnI-fB1AwFziIpbnkgrVZssNWbgrUxT1mMNNoKTIy4ySWLfYhDRRQSBFXR95EtjeXMNDKw00QmYEXR_fmyeGq3GDhF3MceoUt88U7EmwccdORAZ2yBBvI1KYXcwDWuQUGubQrbu-fFWEi88tMfNF-vB3LoTt7qnQUWbdVXk16u0nvKUhaa-Qsn_tNBiIxui_kK2Q) a lot. Ones getting dropped off at the job next week, in fact. Yup, used these for jumping exterior columns, and setting curtain wall Yeah, use it to hang curtainwall. That looks fun! We\\'ve had Brokk machines out for concrete demo before but never had a mini crane robot. Yes! I have to admit I didn‚Äôt know what it was when I was told, ‚Äúa spider crane will be on site‚Äù but my imagination brought me to pretty much what it was. Great name, explains exactly what this badass thing is! Is the a spider droid from Star Wars? The separatists entered the chat lol https://imgur.com/a/jhyeE2q/\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HDvI6HY/\\n\\nWhen you receive a crate of special order glazing units, and the shipping company forgets about gravity. They will fit in a shipping container, just. that\\'s a pretty big one, they work great!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere is ours at my project. installing a tower crane on an existing building, had to bring spyder crane up the freight elevator, that brought up our derrick piece by piece and then the derrick crane brought up our tower crane piece by piece. Pics of course!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/beZpeUU](https://imgur.com/a/beZpeUU) I\\'ve never seen one before, that looks pretty awesome I was slightly disappointed to see that it has tracks. For a minute I thought it could walk and I was super excited. What‚Äôs this used for? Anyone know the certification requirements for running one of these?   Do you have the certified like you would to run a fucking crawler crane and have an NCCCO or CIC or is there some type of exception for this device?\\n\\nI know that cranes with less than 2k capacity do not require a cert and that is how mechanics can run the cranes on the back of their trucks but this is 5k so I‚Äôm curious. Seen that once when the building was tiny. Used it to install an automated car stacker. I‚Äôve used on a previous hotel job in Times Square.  For curtain wall installation. Great if you don‚Äôt have room for a tower or mobile crane.  We did not need a master rigger on-site while this was in use. I am actually going to use one for the concrete superstructure of an out of ground apt. Building. They will leave out a rectangle in the floor above so they bring this up to the next level. Then the hole gets filled in. It will be used to bring rebar and formwork from ground up to current floor! Crane Spider Level 90    \\nDrops PPE (+70 def, 15 pierce resist) and 5x Scrap Metal Spider Crane, Spider Crane, works well in the sun or rain\\n\\nFits through doors, stairways, too. Lifts up boards, or just a screw\\n\\nLook out, here comes the spider crane YouTube strikes again. That‚Äôs a no for me dog. Those are some nice temp stairs You need at least 1 more stringer if not 2 depending on the width. You need to close the risers off with something, new code says they can‚Äôt be over 4‚Äù gaps anymore. Stairs that wide should have 3 stringers. Railing? Also you def need a 3rd stringer. And 2x2s?? I feel like you have a lawsuit/homeowner insurance claim on your hands waiting to happen So no permit? Because if I had to inspect those stairs they\\'d fail. Oof That cantilevered landing on top looks sketchy :-/ Everything about this is rough.  Sorry for your loss bro. Yikes this cant be OPs project gotta be swiped from the internet. Sometimes I can\\'t tell if people posting things here are serious or if they\\'re mocking something they see nonprofessionals do.\\n\\nThis one is good. And I consider looking at post history cheating. Is that a 2x4 post lagged to the beam?!! While we‚Äôre at it..... looks like the beams are carriage bolted to the post and not bearing directly on them. Also looks like the joist cantilever exceeds allowable span, especially considering the stringers are bearing their load on the cantilevered portion. \\n\\nOP- Google AWC deck guide. It is an awesome resource on the proper building codes for deck construction. \\n\\nWe all sounds like dicks, but it‚Äôs better we all come off as assholes, then someone getting hurt. *Please Read in Full!!!*\\nIf a home insurance adjuster ever has to come to your house, this will disqualify you from ANY AND ALL PAYOUTS. A deck and stairs built like that, without permits, is grounds for immediately dismissal of any insurance case!\\n\\nSpeaking as a former carpenter and a current construction PM, do NOT keep those stairs in the long term. You have nails or screws holding the weight of every stair. No stringer straps on the landings. Not even an L brace for the upper set of stairs The top of the upper stringers doesn\\'t have any nail plates connect it to the deck, which I can tell without being shown that you don\\'t have lag bolts into your house.\\n\\nThe short version is, absolutely NOTHING you have built is built to code. The reason we have code is do you don\\'t kill people, not for permit $. NOTHING on that is structural.\\n\\nI mean this in the nicest way possible, but that is a death trap. It is ungodly dangerous and you should take it down. No exaggeration. It won\\'t come down today, or tomorrow. But, in 2 years when that wood is starting to rot because you screwed right into the end grain making any sort of sealing you do pointless. When that wood starts to rot your screws are going to become loose. It will take one person slipping on a set of stairs and catching themselves to knock a stair loose. Also IT DOESN\\'T HAVE RAILS OF ANY KIND. WTF?! You\\'re working 10\\' off the ground without rails.\\n\\nIf you were on my jobsite, I would kick you off and get into my force majeure clauses. If you plan on selling your house within 10 years, you will be passing that death trap onto an unwitting party. I swear I\\'m not trying to be an internet asshole, I\\'m just trying to save someone from breaking a leg or worse. Looks like a nice project, but probably in need of a bit of adjustment to be safe.\\n\\nWhat do your footings look like up close? The one that I can see on the right appears to have potential issues with water retention As mentioned above, shits fucked yo Is it normal in the US to put a wooden pole directly into concrete? In Germany you have to use post support shoes. So water on the ground can not be soaked up by the wood. My dude, you made one of the biggest mistakes a DIYer can make on reddit...you posted pictures of a deck you built. I\\'m a licensed GC in the NE and I\\'m gunna shot straight with you. These look nice, but other than that they are not great.\\n\\n1) That span needs AT LEAST 3 stringers.\\n\\n2) The stringers need to be cut so the treads rest on them. The 2x2\\'s will 100% come loose over time and will most certainly cause an injury when someone inevitably falls through.\\n\\n3) Current code (in most of the US) says that you cant have more than a 4\" open gap on any stair riser. They don\\'t need to be 100% covered, just not able to let a 4\" sphere pas through it. This is to prevent people and kids from falling through or getting stuck.\\n\\n4) The third joist after the top of the stairs is only half sitting on the beam.\\n\\n5) The 2nd floor deck looks to be cantilevered out past the 4x4 post more than 2\\'. This is a big no-no.  You should put another post from the end of that cantilever to support that corner.\\n\\n6) It might be an optical illusion, but the rise of the top step on the first landing looks to be less than 4 inches or so. Minimum rise on a set of stairs is 4\", but the maximum difference between riser heights on any set of stairs is 3/8\". Please use /r/homeimprovement or /r/DIY u/ClassroomDecorum\\n\\nTYL not to post DIY projects in this sub.  YouTube is a BAD source for learning how to do something.  Your local/state building code probably isn‚Äôt very difficult to read, and online access should be free.  That should be your #1 source for this type of project.\\n\\nGood luck with your stair rebuild Is it me or are the top set spaced further than the ones below the landing? Like more than 1/4‚Äù different? I absolutely love when people post DIY stairs on this sub , Yall are so funny 5 or 10 years down the line one of those 2*2\\'s are going to give out and  injure someone badly if you don\\'t inspect it regularly These are what we call treehouse stairs. I‚Äôd be adding another support where the 2 stairs meet in the middle. Handrails would be cool as well. As mentioned,the 2x2 tread supports are also a concern. So many things are off with this Safety man‚Äôs concern is going to be the missing fire extinguisher They probably would have been able to stay if they had the proper ppe. But in all seriousness if someone came to my place of work and started making my life harder or taking my tools they can eat a dick. I mean it may depend on the job lol but Im not gonna sit there and let it happen, even if I know they have a reason to be upset. Your mad at cops, not me bud so take that shit somewhere else. The backstory here is this is my split shift crew from 11am-8pm at San Jose Towers\\n\\nI got a call from my foreman right as this was about to happen. He said protesters were trying to break in where we don‚Äôt have k-rail supporting the fence on East Santa Clara across from City Hall(this is a delivery zone for the window wall). I told him not to confront and get off the site as quickly as possible. At that point there was a lot of shouting and that‚Äôs where this video picks up. The protestors went for my guys tool bags and various pieces of lumber around the site as well as a fire extinguisher. I‚Äôm not sure what was said to get the protestors to move back but they did quickly as seen in the video. I‚Äôve had multiple requests from the owner of the project to our corporate leadership back in Boston to share my foreman‚Äôs phone number. \\n\\nThe reality is our employees lives are on the line daily working in heavy construction, whether or not if they agree with the content of the protests these guys went above their job description to protect their place of work. \\n\\nI‚Äôm down here this morning thanking them in person. I am sorry but the guy in the helicopter reporting is a dumbass. Seems like some cooler heads prevailed and they are walking away. No you dumbass the guys in the hi-vis jackets are construction workers yelling at the idiots to get off their job. Journalism at it\\'s worse right here We, as construction workers, are typically very prideful people who take great joy in seeing our competed projects around town. Not many of them (us) are just going to stand around and watch our hard work get destroyed. Has nothing to do with justice or injustice but, rather having pride in ones self and doing what is right. Is it right how the police handled the GF incident? No. Is it right to destroy someone else‚Äôs property and hard work? No.  Just be better. Get the rosebud! These aren‚Äôt protestors, these are looters. Last I checked, Ghandi didn‚Äôt go around trying to loot everything. \\n\\nI hope they get things back under control soon though. Amazing bravery on the part of those construction workers. Even the police aren‚Äôt willing to face the crowd. I guess y‚Äôall forgot how many riots it took to get union/workers rights. Hand out job applications, the streets would clear in minutes. They did these guys a favor stopping them. There is nothing but danger for anyone fucking around a site like that. They ain\\'t protestors. They\\'re rioters. Fuck them. We construction people have a lots of shit already going, which we handle by ourselves Bunch of losers Cops killing people is what gave us our 5 day work week, 40 hour work weeks, and the benefits we have. Solidarity with them bc god knows cops dont do shit for us. There\\'s are not protesters, these are rioters and domestic terrorist.  They are not protesting shit.  Fuck people like this. I wouldn‚Äôt fuck with hardworking construction workers Disgusting Awesome! And you all know this is the most exciting news out of Downtown San Jose all year ‚ÄúIf you want to sign up for the union please line up 6ft apart and we can get the paperwork started. Tradesmen and women of all types need.‚Äù \\n\\n(People start running out)\\n\\n‚ÄúCome back we offer good money and benefits‚Äù Fucking scum bags Good job guys! Fuck those looters and terrorists [removed] Id shoot them with a hilti gun Good for those workers. Those weak degenerate assholes would\\'ve been turned back immediately at my site. Too many well fed, hard motherfuckers with no love for losers there. We should just shoot all the looters until they release that hero cop Really incredible. That is a ton of steel and concrete Doing one of these in Boston right now. 50ish panels, deepest one is ~140 feet. Good luck! Wow whoever rigged that is a true professional. Holly shit boys. Good on ya. Keep on killing it and be safe. üëäüèæüëçüèΩ Embeds already on nice I love the Engineering that goes in every Construction projects, specially Construction of this magnitude! 32 corners seems like a lot. Were the adjacent landowners unwilling to sell? I know work like this is not easy. But what is the general day-to-day of this kind of large scale commercial construction.   What are the hours and days on/off.  Skill level required. Any other additional info you might throw my way. This is the type of work that makes me feel like my job isn\\'t real construction.  I\\'m always working inside buildings, half the time already finished.  This shit looks pretty intimidating to me.  How long\\'s it take a green guy to catch up and be useful on a site like this? Madonne, grew up in the tri-state area so it was a little easy to become desensitized to all the development that goes on out here-  but whenever I see posts here of what goes into projects of such a scale/scope it blows my mind. \\n\\nKind of gives ya a fresh appreciation for all the crazy development that goes on around here. That\\'s incredible. Please post more pictures of this job. Sweet.  Location? What is a slurry wall? Slurry wall? Not concrete? Does something like that get tied on the gound then lifted You got to have a great deal of respect for these people. Literally any second they could have died. Dangerous, yet noble work. You were right.\\n\\nConstruction looked so much different back then. No welding, power tools, osha, etc. Nothing but respect for those that came before us. This makes my butthole quiver Its water under the bridge. Base on looney tunes  physics they should be fine. Where OSHA got its name. The last thing you heard from a guy falling ‚Äú Oh shiiiiiiiiiitttt........‚Äù I love watching old time construction work videos. So crazy to see how times have changed. OSHA approved [deleted] Nope. Not a single safety harness in sight. Brave souls indeed. Those men have balls of steel Man that looks like Deception Pass on Whidbey Island. Fucking straight bad ass dudes in this video though. fuckin ironworkers still work like this if you aren\\'t up their ass about tying off These guys are chillen because they have never seen final destination r/osha These were men, what a generation. There\\'s a net under them. r/sweatypalms This whole pandemic really just confirms what alot of people already know about the people that sign their checks, I think. Speaking from my perspective, non-union skilled laborer/ assistant superintendent for a gc doing everything I can to get the experience to move into a superintendent position and run jobs on my own. The owner of my company \"cares about everything going on\" but she\\'s breathing down my neck to meet an impossible deadline. And her reasoning? \"It will make us look good\". I hate it, I absolutely want to tell all the subs on the job that they deserve better, and to refuse to work in the conditions our company is forcing them in. But I know it\\'s not going to change anything,  they have kids at home they have to feed. And if they take my advice then someone who doesn\\'t care will just take their place and they would be stuck jobless to just to prevent something that might happen to them. \\n\\nI know I\\'m not going to be with this company forever but I really feel like now wouldn\\'t be a good time to start a job search. So like others I feel like I\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard place. Props to this guy, almost every site I\\'ve worked on has been seriously lacking in hygiene stations and general cleanliness. This guy is right.  Construction companies want essential work to continue so they can keep the checks coming.  For anyone looking to send something to their higher ups, feel free to copy and paste:\\n\\n \\n\\nMost employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around... \\n\\nSince a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum: \\n\\n1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment)\\n2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces \\n3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.)\\n4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other.\\n5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift.\\n6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)\\n\\nI assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.\\n\\nThe first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.  \\n\\nTo conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.  \\n\\nThis is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. All the Hispanic workers are like, \"que?\" I can really resonate with this dude. My situation is a bit different where I work for a small residential GC and we\\'re doing remodels and new construction on people\\'s homes. My state just released an order yesterday that says as of midnight tomorrow, we are to stay at home unless of course we are considered essential, which it is outlined that construction trades are.\\n\\nI don\\'t work with large groups of people but I find myself running to stores a lot for work equipment and supplies, I deliver them to houses where we have trades working and touching everything, and I\\'d be lying if I said I didn\\'t feel a little uncomfortable doing so in times like this where in this area we are watching the number of covid cases creep up. \\n\\nI just had my first child at the end of January. She is two months old today. Her mom hasn\\'t gone back to work and most likely will not since it doesn\\'t make sense for her to keep working service jobs to pay for daycare, and with restaurants being closed for weeks now she wouldn\\'t be working anyway. I\\'m the sole provider for the home life I\\'ve built and I don\\'t want to go to work for fear that I\\'m going to bring this shit home to my family. We are healthy so far but anxious beyond belief. I can\\'t help but google what goes on every day and listen to public radio to hear about the latest developments. While to some extent we are essential that we need to wrap up people\\'s homes for them to prevent fucking up their closing dates or to board up their homes to be safe from the elements, it\\'s hard to stay motivated when I\\'m as worried as I am.\\n\\nI have the most mixed feelings about what is to come. Great that I have a job and still working, I\\'m luckier than most until I wonder if I really am or not when I\\'d rather be safe at home. I don\\'t want to worry anymore if I\\'m going to get my wife and baby sick by trying to provide for them. As someone that runs multi million dollar projects as a GC, this virus has been a detriment to employee morale. We‚Äôve gone to provide as much social distancing measures as possible, proper PPE, and sanitizer stations everywhere. Despite the precautions, workers continue to be very worried. \\n\\nI‚Äôm worried too and I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. When you know just what your company knows, it feels awful knowing if one of your guys gets it, it could put the entire crew at risk. If you get sick at work, you\\'re eligible for workers comp. When employers, and more importantly, workers, realize this then jobs will get shut down. Most everyone on my crew isn\\'t worried about getting severely ill from the coronavirus, they\\'re worried about taking it home and getting their wives, children, or parents severely ill Is this guys company doing their part? It‚Äôs real easy to point the finger at the GC but the GC also doesn‚Äôt have to provide him his PPE either. There‚Äôs a line of company responsibility by his employer as well. \\n\\nGranted some GC are in fact just shy of worthless with respect to the general health and welfare of the workers, but the context here is unclear. \\n\\nIf only guys like this were as passionate about pulling a broom behind them as they go. I love how he steps right on tripping hazard he probably left behind on his way down from his soapbox. I set aside a little bit of that anger for the fucking Communist Party of China who also owns Reddit.  \\n\\n\\nThose fuckers are ground zero almost every single flu.  I think there should be consequences.  We\\'ve all been making them rich for so long now. literally had the same meeting yesterday. All workers have the right to a safe and healthy workplace and also have the right to refuse unsafe work. All precautions should be in place and no one is expected to put themselves at risk. \\nHowever, this guy is another union blowhard who is only interested in stirring up shit to get more memberships. Not productive. Oh look canadians giving up. I\\'d assume they are French canadians This is awful.\\n\\nThe handwriting is legible and you labeled the actual wires instead of using some cheap labels that will fall off or marking them on a separate sheet according to some arbitrary, out-of-sequence numbering system. Where are the burn marks and the randomly protruding screws you use to secure the box loosely to the Sheetrock? \\n\\nSomebody‚Äôs going to not electrocute themselves with this kind of work. Looks good. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different, those 100% perfect panels you see posted take hours to complete. Yours is good, clean, safe, legal and properly organized. Some might argue to put black before read but w/e. That white wire needs to be colored black so you know its hot. 240 2 Pole should be red or black. How are you powering the future from a residential sized service??? Looking good brother! That‚Äôs your company‚Äôs advertising right there! Wow I don\\'t know you\\'re getting compliments. If I were to make up a panel that sloppy, the rest of my crew would never let me live it down.\\n\\nAlso why are you wires crossed over each other? I know it\\'s residential but come on have some craftsmanship If one of my apprentices made this up id make them redo it. Sorry.\\n\\nThe tub appears to be upside down\\n\\nWires should be numbered. What they are should be on the panel schedule.\\n\\nWhy is there a neutral in a 2 pull 30?\\n\\nA and B phase are flipped. And if  you were to keep it like that then wires on 10/12 need to be flipped to be consistent with phasing. Or just reverse the phases and fix 2/4.\\n\\nWire management should be better. Not bad for first time, but definite room for improvement. Why is there a random neutral traveling all the way down to the bottom left instead of landing on the top neutral bar with the rest? If it passed inspection and is easy to follow what does what it\\'s a decent panel I usually take off my labels for my final but now I‚Äôm rethinking that choice. üëç Looks good. I\\'d change the black and red wires but that\\'s it. Looks better than mine. Good job. Literally had to stare at what the labels were to make sure this wasn\\'t one of my pannels.  Your hand writing is exactly like mine and that\\'s about as clean as a panel that I have ever made. Where do  the future ones go to? Looks better than 95% of panels I‚Äôve come across.  The 5% is high end homes. Liking the \"jiffy\". May start to label them all like that myself. Anti oxidation gel on the aluminum mains? As carpenter that will one day look for a breaker to kill power I fucking love you. This is a great job Nice job there Don\\'t let this guy\\'s tell you it looks off. A functioning and legible panel is a good one. \\n\\nPeople spend way to much time making it look \\'perfect\\' Is Noalox not required for those feeders? Or is it a small amount that it isn‚Äôt splooging out? Fuck that Who took the picture? Notice that they all have their safety harnesses on. What a photo! I can\\'t think of a better picture to take on a site...you win You hiring? Instant pins and needles! That size rock sucks to shovel. Have fun. Call Badger and start sucking we installed some drainage pipe for a community center, well we left some stub-ups so we could come back later and put in the actual drainage boxes. Come back the next week and our pipes won\\'t drain a single drop soooo we have to uncover it and re-run it per the superintendents request. We cut into it to tie in and the Entire 8\" of the pipe is filled with concrete. Come to find out when the concrete guys were done with their stuff they used our stub up as a washout and just poured the rest of the concrete down the hole. To this day I will never understand what possessed those people to think that was a valid way to dispose of it. Make him remove the rock Maybe he was trying to make it safer? Or was there guardrails around the hole? Hey, at least it wasn\\'t fresh concrete! To chunky for a vac truck ? Did he fill just the hole? There‚Äôs no rock next to it and it‚Äôs not entirely full. Looks like just the hole was filled. I shovel that rock almost every day...railroad ballast and it fuckin sucks. Much more aesthetically pleasing. How does one accidentally fill such a hole with rock?  They didn\\'t think \"hey this hole doesn\\'t look like the kind of hole that should have rock in it\"? How?\\n\\n\\nWhy? oh fun! Time to jet and vac the manhole and all the lines. lol Guy at work forgot to barricade or put the top back on an unattended man hole and filled it 6‚Äô deep with rock. That‚Äôs a paddlin Gotta throw out the whole job site now I read 6‚Äù at first that did seem that bad.... So what kind of steaks are you gonna cook? Had a ex-supervisor now coordinator drill into sewer accidently and fill a few blocks full of bore crete. Only realised the issue when residents complained and never questioned why he was using cube after cube and not filling the hole. Wouldn\\'t a temporary plywood cover had sufficed? Nice! I just did a 20 hr drive to get home for Christmas (2 days ago)! It\\'s nice to walk away from the end of a project and be confident that your vacation won\\'t be interrupted for things you didn\\'t finish. Congrats, enjoy! Looks hell of a lot cleaner than any roof I\\'ve seen in New York lol. Jesus christ... 130pm sunset and a 25 hour commute. I really need to be more grateful my construction site is across the road from my house and I walk to work. Still getting that sweet sweet fuel allowance though! Where is that you\\'re working? That single ply membrane looks very loosely installed?\\n\\nWhat membrane is it? I\\'m a roofing contracts manager in England  and have never seen a single ply membrane laid so loosely, so many baggy areas in that roof. Looks good. I‚Äôd love to roof in a place like that. from a roofer in the states have fun, roof on and don‚Äôt fall off. I would love to live here instead of New York Be safe on that drive!!! Boom! Enjoy ! What‚Äôs with the loose installation? Is that a typical installation? What type of roof is that pvc? You\\'re well on your way to being a professional capentern.  That is one clean framing site  Looks like some fine, straight walls. \\n\\nNext time video your work, slow down a bit, give us time to appreciate your craft!  Petition to change apprentice carpenter to carp-intern invest in a good hammer, save your arms and shoulders.  Brotherhood for life! Good job brother! I‚Äôm guessing raised would floors? In our area by code we have to float any basement walls due to Bentonite causing the ground to heave if it is a cement floor on the ground. \\n\\nEdit. Never mind. For some reason was thinking it was a basement finish. Job looks clean.  Are you in the northeast? Good job, now keep learning there until you can land a commercial gig. Why do you sound like a pug in heat? Looks awesome!! I\\'ve debated on joining the trade...I\\'ve always wanted to learn to build!  Good job guys :) Good on ya bub Welcome, little brother Great job, bud! Looks good bud. Take pride in your work and always be willing to learn from others and the trade will be good to you. Are those electrical boxes plastic? No idea that was a thing. What type of coating is that on the floor? God I cant even look at another residential job without getting nauseous. It looks good though bud, it\\'s a good start. Good on you. Bitchin Work safely !  Yes, it was getting really bad for me until we started back charging for it. We also started including in our bids for them to make sure they pick up their own personal trash and it has gotten better since. At least the water bottles are not full of pee.  Company used to have this issue, until we issued a worksite policy document to all subs that work with us. Now if they don\\'t clean up the site at the end of each work day they get fined $250.00 per offense. We always have trash bins on site and a dumpster on site where they can throw away debris. We also added a non smoking policy, as a lot of our remodel customers started to complain about the scent of cigarettes. Subs now have a designated smoking area that isn\\'t near the job.  Constantly. If you have a trash can available you have document and fine to slow it down. If you don‚Äôt have a place for the trash then get used to it.  I think part of it is being present as much as possible. As a job is winding down I will drop a offhand \"looks good so far, after you clean up make sure to send me your invoice\" and that gets the point across.\\n\\nAlso I don\\'t back charge I just hold the payment if it is bad. I try to control everything I can and make sure my in house people are extremely clean , if the jobsite is clean when a sub shows up they usually get the idea. I\\'ve always found electricians to be the worst about not cleaning up after finishing their rough ins. Of course this doesn\\'t apply to every electrician but the ones I\\'ve dealt with over the years seem to think they aren\\'t responsible for the mess they create.  We have a system called composite clean up. If a sub has anywhere from 1-10 guys, then they have to provide someone for (8) hours on Fridays to help clean up with all the subs. We have a sign in sheet, and if they don‚Äôt sign in then it‚Äôs a back charge at the rate of a laborer.  I\\'m doing punch lists for a building. There was one guy whose refrigerator broke down. Naturally, he stashed the entire contents of his old fridge into one of mine. A lot of guys had free lunch that day. Gc here- yes, subs are the garbage they leave behind. As most of the comments say- clean sites are a good indication of professionalism.  Those blue 55 gallon barrels make great cheap trash cans with the top cut off. Cheap fix Only everybody ever.  Construction workers are pigs, flat out, it‚Äôs very rare I get a crew that actually understands they are on someone else‚Äôs property, and that they represent their company. \\n\\nYou gotta rub their nose in it and keep track of them. \\n\\nI had one company start writing conditions into job tenders for site cleanliness. Any contractor leaving materials not work related and the whole job is issued penalty on their work. It‚Äôs a bit heavy handed, but on those sites it seemed to work out well.  The absolute biggest kick in the juts is when you bring the trades coffees and then find the cups thrown everywhere. Drives me nuts.\\nI will be implementing a clean up personal trash clause. \\nF that shit.\\n\\n\\nEdit\\nIn Toronto I was at a light facing a construction sight. I along with my dash cam witnessed guys walking up to sight flamboyantly tossing their truck garbage into sight as they walked towards the entrance.\\n\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre building at Mt pleasant Lawrence across from intersection.... it was your foundation guys.  Every job I\\'ve ever worked in SoCal has looked like this.  \\n\\nDeveloper also has always had at least 3 laborers only working for him.  Their duties are sweeping and keeping the street gutters clean for SWPPP reasons, general trash clean up, sweeping all floors once a week and probably things I don\\'t know about. \\n\\nI\\'ve never worked on small jobs though, just big tracks. This looks like my current house that is being built.  One day I had to take a piece of rotting cantaloupe out of the wall that they were about to close in with dry wall!  I just recently sent a picture to my builder where they were going to seal up coke cans, gatorade bottles, water bottles, and just general trash in my island.\\n\\nI hope my builder reads this thread.  I sure dont blame him, but I wish there was a way to get control of the construction crew.  I know they dont care about that house, but I worked hard to earn the money to build this, and that is why they are earning money at their jobs.  I know its hard work, but dont put the trash in the walls in the house that I am going to live in.  Thats just mean! God yes. We (the GC) have spent literally $250,000+ on labor on my current project to clean up after our subs. Luckily all of our subs\\' contracts include \"progressive daily cleanup\", which they sure as hell didn\\'t do and we have the documentation to prove it, so we\\'ll be backcharging them for the entire amount.  C O M P O S I T E   C L E A N U P that\\'s what the gc\\'s laborers are for Lay a broom down on top of it These subs were probably hire for a cheap price. We would never ever leave a job like that. I guess that\\'s partially why we are considered \"expensive \"\\n No. Every sub on our site is immaculate and even sorts their own garbage, recycling and biodegradable items. \\n\\nWHAT THE FUCK KIND OF QUESTIONS IS THIS?!?!?! OF COURSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM!!! WHO THE FUCK DOESN\\'T!!!??!  That\\'s pretty crap of them, since it\\'s so easy to throw things in a bin.\\n\\nBut don\\'t you guys have labourers? I mean, cleaning that up and keeping the site tidy is a job for them, keeps them busy. Proper housekeeping clean as you go. Danny Ramos. Never work with him. Broken wine bottles everywhere.  Omgosh yes!!! I had to go pick up the whole bridge job site yesterday, and I\\'m the only one that actually throws my shit away...I found water bottles literally a foot from the dumpster... seriously dudes?!? Oh the well Yep. Empty packs of cigarettes stuffed into empty bottles everytime. Just randomly bring the trash from your car and put it in theirs works great they will get pissed and request a different site or realize their jackasses and stop being dirty scans Always include specifics in the contract, including removal of job-related debris, tools, food wrappers, water bottles, and any other form of waste etc. They must fulfill all conditions within the contract to get paid.\\n\\nThis means if they don\\'t they have to go back just to pick up their litter if they want to be paid No trash can, not even an old box or a bucket on site is sometimes to blame Every single job. The one I\\'m on now is the worst I\\'ve ever dealt with. Regardless of the contractor they\\'re all slobs. We have 55gal trash cans scattered throughout the buildings, rolling tippys for the big stuff, forklift tippys for getting the trash to the dumpsters. The dumpsters are maybe 40\\' from the door and everyone has to pass them at break, lunch, and leaving for the end of the day when they walk back to their cars. We hound people daily, enforce the rule in their contract about composite cleanup crews and try everything possible. None of it works. The guys we\\'ve got are slobs, plain and simple.  How about pick up after yourself like a grown up or a decent human being.   Add in contract that the sub starting work is a condition of acceptance of the site condition. \\n\\nIf they accept a dirt workplace, they get to clean it up - along with their own mess - daily. \\n\\nThis forces the issue via he GC on the previous trade. \\n\\nIt works.  Charge them a fee for the clean up, that\\'s what my company does. Back charge all day, man  We get in so much shit for leaving anything around, especially garbage stuff. I mean, those water bottles deff were in a cooler etc, it‚Äôs easier to just put it back, or most new sites literally have recycling bags near the garbage.  \\n\\nMy buddy use to say, we should just go round up the homeless people and get them to clean up all the cans an stuff.  Train them with safety an let them pick it up.  Guaranteed they‚Äôll be there every other day after work to get their cans lol \\nI know it‚Äôs not as easy but picking up after yourself seems like a far fetched idea  [deleted] Well done. Health is above money. A new meaning for DEAD LINE Being on a basket lift is about as good social distancing as you can get. So the carps and the painters huh? BAC is gonna be up on the wall till jesus calls it himself. Mason love baby, stay safe. Thought this was r/jokes for a minute. [deleted] [deleted] Can\\'t read. paywall Oh fuck they slaughtered your girlfriend. Those bastards. T\\'is merely a fleshwound! I don‚Äôt wanna post it but I got attacked by a power planer today...fingers nice and smooth now. Still at the hospital cause my boss made me go\\n\\nEdit: Fuck it, don‚Äôt look if you gotta weak stomach https://imgur.com/a/9jlRJoH What got ya. How much paperwork? I hate to ask, but was the thumb just kinda hanging on after it happened? Superglue, duct tape, back to it. My foreman fell down the stairs today, so to fuck with him we painted a white body out line where he fell lol üëç Better than yours! ‚ÄúSorry sir I can‚Äôt piss for you I hold my dick with my left hand‚Äù Good luck thuming a lift like that Hope you heal soon brother! I\\'ll see your cut thumb, and raise you a [shredded elbow](https://ibb.co/G7QbTwm).\\n\\nOk, it didn\\'t happen onsite; it\\'s a road injury. I just wanted in on the body horror train (users posting injures) as it\\'s leaving the station. That looks like a serious ouchie bro. So whatchya do? Get well soon, sir. Sporty little Thursday Better than yours Step one working construction...Don\\'t let the damn thing kick your ass...\\'cause it will. Super drove his truck through our nearly finished Mitsubishi reno project... it was a great day of clean up! Broke my tibia climbing on the track of the excavator. ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Landscaper tore apart my power cord with a backhoe, a framer across the street fell of the second floor of a house, and my truck\\'s transmission is on its last leg.\\n\\nBut at least my hand is in-tact. Jesus dude. Ya skillsaw yourself? Exam day already? Workday was fine. Blew my tire on the way home. Speedy recovery my friend! Gloves Jesus christ I did osha 30 all day. Clearly the tile worker needs some more safety training Don‚Äôt know if gloves would have helped in this situation, but damn, pictures like these are why I have my gloves on as soon as I start working . Stay safe out there bros .üëçüèª Looks like rookie hands. Keep at it. Soon enough your calluses will have calluses. Now go dip your hands in some salty water and then dry them off with steel wool. You‚Äôll be good as new in the AM. Fuck that Cute little 66‚Äô parked next to me for scale. üòÇ My favorite thing about booms that high is when the boss comes and says ‚ÄúHey I need you to...‚Äù\\n\\nJust boom up. All they way up and scream down ‚ÄúWHAT?!‚Äù Until he walks away. I didn\\'t know they went that high. What sort of work are you doing at 185\\'? I like the part where it feels like you\\'re sill swaying around when you\\'re trying to sleep. I was on a 135 fully extended when a huge gust of wind blew me away from the building then swung the basket through the window.   I was never scared of heights or anything until that moment.   I came down and talked to the PM for a bit explaining the incident when a dude came in hysterically going on about the guy who went through a window.   Like it really freaked the dude out You guys see the video of the guys lift tipping and they swing by their harnesses? Cray  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10213724371079351&id=1107750939&sfnsn=mo Nope no fucking way. I had to gag dens glass out of a 120 and that was sketchy enough.  Nope Nope....how are the pavers holding up?  I can‚Äôt even imagine, does that thing just swing all the fuck over the place?? *is a tower crane operator*\\n\\nYou don\\'t scare me. I dropped my side cutter, fml... I don\\'t care what the science says, nothing will ever make me feel a boom or scissor lift looks stable to me. When I see a fully extended boom lift, I see an industrial ceiling fan mounted with drywall anchors. I know that boom has a wide stance, but how can you get that high without some outriggers? \\n\\n  The highest I\\'ve been up to is around 80\\' or so. I don\\'t mind heights, I think ~180\\' would be fun.\\n\\n  Are you a bigger guy? I\\'m a small guy and all the big guys that I worked with didn\\'t like heights, so I always ended up in the basket, lol. I like how it jerks when you max out an extension and makes you think it\\'s about to drop your ass. You want me to go up there? Tie me off to the building otherwise FUCK OFF The sway though.  I\\'m not afraid of heights but I fucking hate the 185, Ive literally climbed all the flights of stairs on a heater and climbed out the steel rather then use it. Fucker has so many autoleveling safety features, hate it What\\'s the rental cost on that monstrosity? The 155\\' I used last summer was around $20k a month. Haven\\'t gotten to see a 185\\' in the wild yet. What trade are you in? And I get scared going full extension on a 40 footer! At least it‚Äôs almost straight up, hate seeing a spring board waiting to happen,  NOPE  How far can you boom out horizontally before the tires come off the ground?  Nice! Im often on 60s and 85s, but my company doesn\\'t do much work needing anything taller. I would love to operate one some day. Yikes! Very nicely done, sir. I was on the same lift, but only needed to go to 120. In fact, it would have been freaky to go any higher because there would have been nothing around lol Looks a lot like Oregon State University Now shake the basket back and forth wuss. r/sweatypalms  Neeeeeeeope Can that thing fit through a double door opening?  Electrical tape is part of every tradesman\\'s triage kit\\n\\nFucking stabbed through my hand one time, started bleeding everywhere, found some gauze and wrapped my hand like ten times with electrical tape and got back on my staging  I was cooking a few weeks ago and cut my finger while chopping, and by instinct I grabbed some paper towel and electrical tape and kept going. It\\'s nice to know some people understand, because my wife thinks I\\'m insane  True story. I got wrote up for a safety violation for not having my hi-vis vest on once. The reason I didn‚Äôt have it on? \\n\\nAn electrician almost got his arm cut completely off by a piece of glass the glaziers dropped from the third floor. I used my vest to pack the wound and wrapped his arm in stego-tape. \\n\\nI feel bad for whoever had to remove the tape at the ER. Stego-tape might as well be fucking welded on once it sticks in 100* weather.  Only used when ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll stop bleeding‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work  ITT: compliance officer\\'s worst nightmare You see the problem here is that you‚Äôre not supposed to do that. Case closed. We righted it and did a thorough inspection but luckily the hoses and knuckle for the articulation had enough movement it was ok This is how you know your training program needs to be looked at. Closely. This is exactly what these haul trucks are designed for. Flop the body which is just a bunch of steel, and the cab stays upright which is where all fragile components are ( people,engine, electronics) are. Unless something lodges in the body, at which point the cab will flop and the body will stay up. So was this an articulated truck before the event?  \\n\\n(/s if needed) How much poo came out of him when this happened and when the boss got him? Good time to grease the U-Joints. When he asked where to dump you should\\'ve specified \" out the back of the truck\" r/wellthatsucks Jesus people this is literally what it‚Äôs supposed to do. It‚Äôs the safety feature to let the dump bed roll, notice the cab is  upright. Yes it sucks, but this is not at all uncommon. Ground personnel would be watching for this in most situations and steer clear of being near it. \\n\\nI haven‚Äôt been on a crew that isn‚Äôt aware of it, every good foreman should make it clear, not just with this machine but all heavy equipment. I‚Äôm sure the young operator was shocked and a little shook up, but again...it‚Äôs designed for this and being in truly off-road conditions where this is more likely than we‚Äôd like it to be. Not enough common sense to operate heavy equipment. Your fault more than his to be honest. It\\'s dumped. that front end loader will get it back up no worries Lol seen it a ton \\n\\n\\nWhy oh why is it always a wiggle wagon? A friend of mine was tasked to dig a massive crater on his first day. Didn\\'t know what it was for til his boss told him to dump a bunch of dead cows into the hole and to cover them. I‚Äôve done worse lol WTF ! Words to live by Holy balls, you‚Äôre really having yourself a day. Rolling a dump truck, burying a scissor lift, and redoing all your formwork! Maybe time to bag it. Ahh Dumper yoga   sexy Does it still work? What\\'s that, an 83\\' Volvo?  \\n\\nI leaned to drive a rock truck in the size up of this one, but the cab looks super familiar. union? Bad supe. I\\'m guessing it was also his last day in the truck? *last U fucked his wife didn\\'t you? You dog We had an inspector once who would walk into a disabled bathroom and sit on the grab rails. \\n\\nIf the plywood patrices weren‚Äôt installed we ended up with a floor full of broken wall tiles and plasterboard.\\n\\nIt only happened twice... Second the ‚ÄúWut?‚Äù\\n\\nWhy is the plywood covered in sheet metal? \\\\*cries in estimator I‚Äôve built a lot of commercial projects and I‚Äôve only seen this kind of armoured backing in the ‚Äúwet‚Äù cells of an airport border services facility. Is this just office space or somewhere special? Everybody gets to fight over this change order! Inspector ain‚Äôt paying. If the spec says the bathroom has to be ADA (and it almost always has to be) the estimator screwed the pooch if he didn‚Äôt put in for extra backing If you\\'re anything like the gcs we work with, you didnt plumb a stud or pull layout and it\\'ll all end up on the ground anyway Inspector prepping for the hulk to use this bathroom Is this for a bariatric washroom? lol Yeah kuz you know .. fatties Lol wut? I spent months doing just plywood backing all day errday, but I\\'ve never seen sheet metal on top like that. Stud manufacturers like Clarkdietrich limit the amount of perforations you can make in a given span.... that might‚Äôve exceeded the limit Fuck that! Is this a DSA project?\\n\\nProbably a bigger deal that all of the stud are 20 Ga. Pro studs TBH. Is that a pvc plug in a cast iron clean out? As someone who used to install a lot of cabinets and other millwork, this blocking is God sent. That‚Äôs an overkill. What strikes me, is that you are allowed to leave a connection of a waterpipe inside the wall. This wouldn‚Äôt be allowed where I work. All connections have to be accessible. Did the inspector pay the change order? I\\'m a PE for a company that does public works construction in California, primarily schools. In my experience our Inspectors (DSA) don\\'t have authority to direct this kind of thing without a citing a specific code requirement. If they wanted to see something like this it would have to come from the engineer, in the form of a response to an RFI or some other field directive.\\n\\nIn other sectors or states can inspectors just decide they want something done a certain way without consulting an engineer?\\n\\nJust tryna learn. Inspectors get a kick out of being massive infected schlongs\\n\\nMy favorite inspectors are the ones dealing with gas - it seems like literally every single gas inspector has his own set of rules and regulations that contradicts the others The last commercial job I ever did we had to put backing like this in 300 units because they wanted it to be ADA convertible \\n\\nFuck commercial Swiss cheesed that backing lol i‚Äôm surprise they didn‚Äôt make you put the middle truss screw into the flat stock lol What\\'s the purpose of all the screws? Dan\\'s backing for the win Reminds me of OSHPD. Fuck those guys. weird for an inspector to call on, but \"deadwood\" is really smart to put into bathrooms in general. Were the plans approved by the city or whoever issued the permit? Having installed many many grab bars with deficient backing, this is overkill but appreciated. That\\'ll be a bitch to change a leak Why metal? We used to use the metal strips for grab bars. This seem kind of over kill to me. A few jobs I was on had us use 1/4\" steel plates for the grab bars. That was also over kill. \\n\\nI\\'m loving the cast iron. Thats how we roll in NYCü§ò It doesn‚Äôt matter what you use for backing as long as it holds the proper amount of weight. It‚Äôs easy to find those numbers for metal and wood. This is bs, the inspector is pissed about something and you guys didn‚Äôt call him on it. Plus In twenty years in Colorado I‚Äôve never had to inspect backing once, but it might be different elsewhere. A lot of jobs I‚Äôve done the backing is means and methods meaning we use whatever we want as long as it meets spec. Sounds like this guy has dropped a bit too much acid in his youth, how do mount anything without hitting a screw head? Wut This is why we qualify 2x8 instead for our multifamily units in stead of flat strap. Don\\'t have to worry about stud Guage or notching studs. Are you hanging safes on those walls? Rather this than a lawsuit years later for old mr.smith holding on to a weak shower bar r/skookum I am not feeling the love in these comments. I had an inspector like that\\n\\nWtf. But my book says [deleted] The plans had no detail for the backing in the washrooms? That\\'s crazy with the flat stock on top though, I\\'ve never seen that before. Some flat strap would\\'ve done the trick lol. Is seismic even a concern for the cabinets?? Change. Order. Did he decide that? Or is it in the spec? Why is the bathroom self leveled? Does it not get tile? \"Welp, time to go buy a sawzall.\"  -That dumbass So just the safety bar showed up to work today? That fucking chain brake saved his face/life, he should gold plate that piece and put diamonds in it! I\\'ve had that reaction a mnay times when I was mitering a pipe and the matabo decided it was done being a team player I never had a close call this bad, but a couple of times a year when I do have a close call that makes me realize I‚Äôm not focused, i wrap it up and go home for the day. Holy shit, what a way to go. I think r/OSHA would like to have a word, Sir. Time to change my shorts! Damn it Jerry!! Welp, I just went saw to head. Time for a beer . Playing 80‚Äôs music and thinking Scarface. Just use jigsaw Never stand behind the bar, for god sakes Yup fuck dat shit. r/whatcouldgowrong Dear God! Put that thing away and never use it again I had a 6‚Äù hole saw kick on my once and hit me in the face.  It stopped spinning right before it hit me or else I would look like me potato head right now. I definitely would have shipped my pants. I think the guy recording this wanted ol buddy to slice himself down the middle. Hahaha dude stepped down like \"here,you can have this thing. I am done for the day.\" Sitting at home right now cause of getting hit at work last week with a concrete chainsaw in the face. This almost made me sick. Not trying to say what the dude was trying to do was acceptable or safe...\\n\\nBut if he oriented the saw so it could cut from the \"bottom\" of the bar, he would have been fine. Is that Jerry from Parks and Rec? Wasn\\'t even wearing any PPE. Dude had zero brains. Holy shit! He almost cut his unibrow off OSHA wants to know your location r/WhyWereTheyFilming Man, you guys complain when we barely make it out to the jobsite, and then make fun of us when we do. Lol \\n\\n&#x200B; In order;\\n\\nInspector, Site Manager, Crew Forman and Surveyor Quality control is really important being on both sides of this, those guys dont like it either. if they could, they would rather stay at the office or in the trailer, doing their work, and not dicking around on site being hated by everyone else. \\n And a 7th guy taking pictures to post on reddit. As a former union superintendent, this is tame. I\\'d been those laborers for years, it killed me to watch it happen. My crews loved catching pictures of me with the other white hats and sending them to me because they knew it bothered me.\\n\\nMy biggest dislike about unions is how I was not allowed to help labor anymore [deleted] I like that hi-vis rebar cap.\\nOh, wait. This isn\\'t r/OSHA That is nothing when I was a project engineer we had myself the Assistant project manager the superintendent, 2 manufacturers represenitives, the subcontractors projectmanager and the owner all watching 2 workers installing a rubber waterproofing on a elevator pit.  \\n\\nThat is 8 people watching 2 people work if you lost count. I felt bad for them. Why so many people working?? Why does anybody feel bad about this? \\n\\nIt really sucks when people above you are incompetent, but that‚Äôs what I went to school for. So I can stand right there with those guys and not feel bad.  Or they‚Äôre working on design. A super to say what  can be done, a PE to RFI it, a pm and an engineer from the sub, or architects.  I can hear them now.  ‚ÄúWhy the hell are we three weeks behind schedule??!! Hey Jose, you sure you‚Äôve been working 12 hour days??!!‚Äù There are a lot of hurt feelings in this thread Could be a safety/quality control audit. To be fair, I went to school for 4 years and busted my ass as a laborer for many years before going to school. I get even more hate from the guys because I‚Äôm ‚Äúyoung‚Äù even though I‚Äôm not lol. I‚Äôve earned my spot as a clipboard warrior. At my last job there would be 3 or 4 of us plus the owner standing around watching 3 people work. I do get hands on though simply because I get bored or if I‚Äôm tired and want some activity. The Union summed up in one photo.  Hey, those CM student loans aint gonna pay for themselves.  [deleted] Now imagine 33 miles of 2 lane motorway at 50mph average speed check because one man is putting out cones while another man is picking up those same cones at the other end  Not typical in the UK. Supervisors are often having to do the work themselves due to cost cutting or labour shortage  And guess who gets paid more Real question is putting the block up there OSHA has entered the chat That‚Äôs pretty smuckin fart.  Solid as a rock!  I‚Äôm being genuine, by the way. Dawg it\\'s called a scissor lift There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this I‚Äôve been on tons of setups like that. This one time we were building a set of fire stairs in a 65‚Äô tall block wall shaft..that was some real sketchy shit. We had ladders clamped to the stair framing 4 stories up. We were tied off so no real worry but damn was that a rush being up there. OSHA has entered the chat This is why there are so many workplace accidents in the United States, hire a scissor lift and save a life. Are they going to need a scaffolding crew to change the bulb? 12awg can lights? Must be a big honking circuit unless they aren\\'t using LEDs. Pheeew, sweaty palms. Hope it all worked out! Thays legit... I think. üëç Seriously.... Dont knock it. How do you even.... You: Hey man, don\\'t knock it if it works. Am\\'arite?\\n\\nOSHA:  Here\\'s yer sign you know its not that hard to build a wooden scaffold ‚ÄúGreen horn, climb out there and wire that light‚Äù Is it me, or is that light can at an angle and gonna light up that adjacent wall all day, instead of the living space below? How old is that ladder? We‚Äôve banned all aluminum ladders on site for years now. [deleted] Working for that compo claim!! OSHA wants to know your location [works just fine ](https://imgur.com/gallery/beCpaaB) Couldn\\'t you just use a lift? Maybe a Perry lift? I have 4 levels for this sort of thing. I dont get why the creativity for something thats safe and  designed by engineers that already exists isnt used more often on this sub from what I see. No. I won\\'t knock it for working, I will, however, knock it for flying in the face of OSHA. [deleted] That 2x rated for 600lbs? Cause if it fails, game ova. Wasting time building intricate scaffolding. If I was your boss, I‚Äôd fire you for this bullshit. He‚Äôs not wearing safety glasses! They said he had to tie off. They just never told him where.  Many times I felt like doing that on my job. WTF is that rebar even for? Are they really encasing that column in concrete? That\\'s, ugh, interesting.  I\\'d bet my paycheck this was taken on a Monday It\\'s cheaper because there\\'s no OSHA to slow things down or force you to spend money on nonsense like harnesses.  r/OSHA  foxcon construction worker Getting off while getting paid.... Somebody‚Äôs having a bad day. It isn\\'t bearing much load now. \\n\\nI was working on a remodel of a lake house early in my career and we started removing some really pretty, 3/4\" thick Cypress siding from the interior walls. Got to where a steel beam carried across the entire length of the room in the basement (probably 30\\' span) carrying about half of the upstairs. We removed the piece of siding next to the piece that was under the beam and realized that the siding was all that was still holding the beam in place. Never seen a group of guys haul ass out of a house that fast in my life. Also never seen load bearing siding before or since that project. Damn your strong! Just disintegrating that shit! Well that makes no sense. Load should be on that concrete wall behind the studs. My advice is to never do termite work if possible Replace with metal studs and never deal with termites again! My friend had a rental property with a termite infestation, the only thing holding up the building was the lattice on the outside wall That‚Äôs a change order. Angry disappointed client who thought you were supposed to have x-ray vision. how is it still standing? Yeah, but there are plenty of factors that can make it hard to build. Yours is an awesome story, though, lol. Makes me want to wear a dust mask... or not.\\nGot the Black Lung pops. How do you even fix this? Shit I physically cringed watching this. Florida?? satisfying to watch termites need to be moist to live.  Once the moisture is gone everything can be replaced one piece at a time.  You can also get treated lumber that is pest resistant. H I don\\'t see anything wrong That looks like it\\'s inside of a concrete wall, so I\\'m guessing the joists are not load bearing at all and that the concrete actually would be the load bearing wall. Am I missing something here? be careful, those splinters are load bearing! the load is on that concrete wall...are you not in a basement? Omg stop Termites are a huge problem in Charleston.\\n\\nCertain neighborhoods theres damage in every home.\\n\\n- i had someone working in an attic have the ceiling joists fall (thankfully in a corner only and got caught on the A frame ladder)\\n\\n- i have had someone have a leg go through the subfloor in a kitchen during a demo remodel while we were doscussing the project.\\n\\nBe safe!? I hate the port-a-toilets.  Do a jobsite safety meeting addressing this as a health hazard.  Explain in detail what should and should not go into it. Maybe 3 out of 100 guys on my site would actually read and understand this note Post it in Espa√±ol Lol one job in particular the portapotties were so bad. Like people pissing everywhere, shitting on top of seats, tp everywhere, etc. I get an email from the lead super intendant (I was a the tile pm) basically saying that he cannot believe it, but for the first time in his career he is shutting down the job and having a mandatory sitewide meeting about toilet training... I couldn\\'t stop laughing, and should have gone to the meeting. And also saved that email. He has one of those older supers who didn\\'t take any shit and chewed everyone out. Seen it all kind of guy. It\\'s worst in other parts of the world.  At a construction site, when you go to some parts of the building and find crumpled bags of cement, you cover your nose.  They seal up pipe for floor drains to keep workers from \"using\" it. I know when I was in California Hispanic workers would only throw tp in the trash...and if there was no trash they would throw them on the floor. A lot of times, it‚Äôs hispanic guys that do it because they think it‚Äôs going to clog up the drains. (Yes it‚Äôs a portapotty but they do it out of habit/not realizing) \\n\\nAll you have to do is make up some superstition or rumor about not putting toilet paper in the drain and they‚Äôll start doing it. I wrote \"Hey, have a great day\" to break from the usual I see, and someone replied \"Thx U 2\". Had a couple of serial garbage can pissers on a new construction tower at a hospital.\\n\\nThe laborer who had to clean the bathrooms on every floor left notes like this for a dozen floors. Hey that guy is a hero when you run out of tp! We had ppl intentionally stuffing the pisser with tp in phx.  Apparently it‚Äôs a joke the mexicans make that they think is funny for some reason haha I do that and I\\'m not Hispanic. It\\'s to clean up the piss on the floor before I drop my trousers in it to take a deuce. These comments about Hispanics thinking that port-a-shitters are piped in are ridiculous. A lot of those guys are way smarter than mouth breathing plumbers or iron workers I know. Somebody put a lot of thought into this Can confirm the water is mixed with bleach. This should have been a thing on all jobsites betore Coronavirus Props to whomever did this.  May not be the prettiest of things, but they are working on keeping the guys safe(r).  We can\\'t even find a biffy that still has sanitizer in it I like this, virus or not. Hi there, entry level Project Engineer for a GC here in the states and there are no hand washing stations left to rent in our area. Going to duplicate this set up this weekend for our guys. Even if it comes out of my $1200 stimulus check the gov is dishing out for people. Thanks for posting, this really means more than you know. All that work then you put the soap in a container you have to touch lol. How‚Äôs that on/off work? Better put in Spanish too Meanwhile, no paper in the shitter.. I like it, but you should only be hand washing in potable water. Not OSHA compliant unless it‚Äôs in Spanish too!!   (Buzzer) If you look closely you can see the safety chain... Attached to nothing. Oh man that\\'s going to be a TON of fun to explain and then pay for all the things they are going to say you messed up; from the water leaks they will surly blame you for years to come to the new sod they are getting.... Go get his check. I\\'ve seen fights over far less severe safety violations. Fuck that guy. What was dropped? Huh.. don\\'t see a problem here ¬Ø\\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Why does it have one short fork and one long one? Did a fork break? Lol not even fucking close This is my worst fear Everytime our one eyed, recovering crack addict operator gets in the lift. It\\'s just the angle that makes it look that way Big Loey! Leaned on the \\'fork down\\'  I\\'ve had my forks get stuck moving down slowly while dropping a beam 4 stories up, quickly turned off the machine and called the mechanic. More like the lol, amirite? Fuckin Murcia lol There I was. Somme, France, 1916. I found myself alone in a trench behind enemy lines. I had only my pvc glue grenades, not much, but the mess and vapors would be enough to dissuade at least a few Hun electricians from getting close. As the fog and the dark rolled in, I heard the jingling of side cutters and wire strippers and voices speaking a language I couldn‚Äôt understand. One of Ohms, supply and neutral. My heart sank, and I cursed Daylight savings time as I unscrewed the lids. Wow. Amazing shot. I dig it Is there a trench box just out of sight?\\nLooks like a grave. Love the few weeks out of the year where I get to turn the lights on because I need them. Great shot here \\n\\nAnd I‚Äôd love to see the look on the bosses face when one of you idiots said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going in there‚Äù üòÇ This is a damn good picture you filthy devil. Daylight savings is over. Dont blame it. Without it, the sun would set pretty early all year. Ah we are going to need a banana for scale. Looks like 12,000 lb mini ex likely has 24‚Äù bucket so at most the trench is twice the width so no more than 4‚Äô deep.  Looks like nice stable clay soil.  I would work in it. Great photo. I can totally see this becoming a marketing campaign image.    \"We do the dirty work so you don\\'t have to\" with the plumbing company logo and phone number below. I can almost hear the german mortars in the background Personally I stay out of any trenches deeper than 3ft if they aren‚Äôt braced. It would be terrifying to have one collapse and restrict my chest so I couldn‚Äôt breathe, you can suffocate to death that way. r/accidentalrenaissance worthy? (on mobile... Hopefully that linked right) cross post this to r/pics This needs to be an ad - nice shot r/beneathyourcity r/Beneathyourcity yeesh, wouldnt find me in that trench if it wss raining. good way to get buried Umm excuse me this is not OSHA approved I‚Äôll have to contact your boss and fucking ride your ass about safety for 30 minutes.

When I started out as a laborer, I brought in a little black charcoal grill after a few months on the job.\\nId cook up about 8 or so bratwurst and sell em to the other trades 5$ a pop.

In a general contractor and I do this with my labor workers every other week  Oh yeah! One time our driver (who is Iranian) made the guys on site some amazing Iranian kebabs with some chunky vegetable (salsa?) and flatbread. Best lunch ever!  Hahah yea i hear ya Just bought a WSM for the trailer. Going to start chicken and ribs for the safest crew of the week every Friday.  We do Thursday, but same same I used to make barabacoa beef for tacos in a crock pot, set it up in the lunch tent during the safety meeting then chow down with my crew at lunch  You should see the look on people‚Äôs faces when I break out my camp chair. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm some Ham and Egger genius. If I brought a Weber I would have to push broom the mess of all the minds blown. Enjoy your bucket suckers! I work on a small crew residential crew, we have a panini press that we cook just about everything on, every day.   Battery powered dewalt 60 volt grill?  I walked into the trailer this week and found two bags of charcoal. My Super tells me he‚Äôs bringing his smoker in. I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing! Uhhhh rub it in guys!..we‚Äôre not even allowed to have food or drinks on site on a lot of jobs.. like not even bottled water. Shit. Y‚Äôall hiring? Lol  I live in LA and you guys look expensive!

It‚Äôs one of the disconnects between the office and the field. It usually doesn‚Äôt bother me much until I hear one of the inappropriately dressed people complain about the mud/water/dirt. Doesn‚Äôt even dawn on them that the appropriate thing to do is to dress accordingly. \\n\\nMuch higher on my list of things that grind my gears from the office end is the unbalanced sense of urgency. The architect thinks it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to take 4 months to choose a color. But thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous that it takes 6-8 weeks to get the material after the color choice is made. That\\'s a bad job out of the super.  That shouldn\\'t be allowed. Office guy here at an engineering firm. Our team is required to have in the office boots, hard hat, eye protection, jeans, vis vest, the whole 9 yards. When an office guy has to make a visit to the site (and it‚Äôs pretty rare) they gotta have everything the boys and girls in the field have. If not, we get chewed out pretty good by our boss.\\n\\nSo it‚Äôs not everyone! So as a woman in a construction office role, I am always very aware of having my PPE.  I really want to blend in with the site as much as I can. The main issue I\\'ve noticed is with customers that want to visit the site. Sometimes they are dressed inappropriately, and we do our best to let them know when they can/can\\'t visit and provide them with PPE. The steel toe boots are really a sticking point for a lot of office workers and customers. As a woman, it can be really hard to even find a pair in stores. This shit kills me. The hazards don‚Äôt care if you are an office person or a field person, or if you‚Äôre onsite for 10 minutes or all day every day. We had a gal show up in high heels, with all sorts of dangling jewelry and apparently that was a-ok. The way I look at it is if you come out to the site to do anything and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to dress appropriately you are not prepared for your work, same as if they forgot their laptop. My mentor drilled it into me early on that showing up dressed appropriately and with proper PPE is step one towards being prepared for and organized to complete your work. It‚Äôs something that has really stuck with me and I do my best to pass that mindset on. As an engineer, allow me to apologize for my people\\'s part in this matter. I\\'ve personally never seen an engineer on a site without the proper PPE, but I\\'m sure it happens. In fact, I\\'d say that we tend to be over-protected, because we often don\\'t know what the site will be like, so we bring everything Yeah not gonna lie every company I\\'ve worked for expected management to be setting an example. I wear all the standard stuff plus I wear my glasses regardless of the situation.  I know it looks dorky but how am I going to expect guys in the field to be safe if I can\\'t be bothered? [deleted] [deleted] I\\'m a pm. I\\'ve kicked architects off site for not having proper ppe.\\n\\nSafety is everyone\\'s job. If anyone isn\\'t following the rules, they get told to go play a different game for another gc. This is why I only do residential and small commercial. I rock up at the job, immediately get naked and start putting mud on the wall. Why four inch sleeves? Even better, the chewing out generally has the tone of ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre better than the guys in the field?‚Äù \\nI used to be a waterproofer in the field, so I greatly appreciate that. Agree completely. This needs to be a zero tolerance thing [deleted] 40c, no shade, no wind in coveralls/steeltoes... The whole shabang, Running one of those 20 pound makita angle grinder on drill pipe boxes I had to roll around the racks; Sorry but the risk of heatstroke is greater than whatever a 1/4\" angle grinder disk can do to my fleshy bits without coveralls (not the fancy breathable nomex shit either we\\'re talkin\\' heavy cotton grease-suit) - That\\'s I snapped and pulled the \"I\\'m not working in these conditions with this much gear find someone else or I\\'m fucking off and going home\" and they fucked off and I got to do my job. - Felt good man.\\n\\nThe earplugs/safetyglasses/faceshield/gloves/respirator stayed on of course but I went sandals/shorts and a white shirt that I soaked in water every 15 minutes because fuck working in coverall in 100f+ temps.\\n\\nBeing forced to wear hardhats doing a roof with 30km/h+ winds gusts was also a good one despite the OSHA exemption for us when there are no overhead hazards because OSHA is not OH&S we still had to wear em, fuck did that piss me off to no end, whelp by the end of the day the hardhats were either tight enough to give ya a gnarly headache or ya stopped giving enough of a fuck to go down 4 stories to go pick it up every-time the wind blew it off. They kept giving us a shit but we got a bunch more jobs from em after the fact so I guess they didn\\'t mind that much...\\n\\nDon\\'t be too afraid to tell folks to fuck off (politely with some tact of course) if they bust your balls too much. Just don\\'t become complacent about the dangers at play, Mike Row said it best; \"Safety third\", stay sharp and get it done.\\n\\nStay safeish! [deleted] Yeah I‚Äôve always hated the second set of rules for the white collar crowd. That‚Äôs not allowed our jobsites. I‚Äôm a PM and full PPE is required if I set foot outside the office area. Goes for everyone, we‚Äôve even told Truck drivers to come back at another time if they have shorts on, I typically let it slide since we need the parts but the safety guys will be all over them. Rarely see that in my area. But in reality it\\'s a matter of insurance. I do CAD now, and opened my own shop. When I was talking to the insurance agent about my job, I wanted to be clear that I would be going to job sites, but that my main function was office. I want to be covered in all cases but I don\\'t want to pay more if they\\'re treating myself and workers like we\\'re full time field guys. \\n\\nAlso for heat management; usually better to be wearing long sleeves than short sleeves or no sleeves. Keeping the sweat on you longer keeps you cooler and slows dehydration. Working in an oil refinery, had to shave my beard, wear nomex, hardhat, steel toe boots, the whole shebang.\\n\\nEngineer comes out to walk the job, he\\'s a Sikh,  long fucking beard, hardhat wouldn\\'t fit over his turban, so no hardhat, and he\\'s wearing sandals! Fucking sandals!\\n\\nTo be honest I was most pissed about the beard. As one off those assholes from the office...it has to to with the duration of the risk and activity which creates the risk. An inspection job does not require the same safety gear. \\n That said, making sure to wear the basics before entering a site (proper footwear/helmet/hearing protection). Always check with the on site manager on gear and about potentiol risk factors going on. You know what grinds my gears as a supt? Fucking delivery drivers who don\\'t have proper PPE even though it\\'s on the damn BoL and they\\'ve been to the jobsite before. We were building a large medical facility and the first stage was already finished so the offices were occupied by the company who owned the whole building.\\n\\nThey decided to do a random walk through, they had hard hats and hi vis, they walked in high heels and a guy was complaining the rough ground was going to damage the soles of his leather shoes.\\n\\nHad engineers walk about with runners but we get fucked for not ticking off a check I\\'m a PM and have worked for several GCs. This wouldn\\'t fly at any jobsite I\\'ve ever been on even if they are the owner of the project. Do you work in the south or for a small GC with a terrible EMR? I‚Äôm a Project Engineer and our company (GC) strictly requires every PE, PM, etc., to have Red Wings or equivalents when on-site. Also we won‚Äôt let Architects or Owners walk on the site without jeans and work boots and proper PPE. Then again, we‚Äôve had one of the best safety records of any GC in our area. Look, the people you refer to aren\\'t working on site every day and often just visit on occasion to do site reviews etc. How can these people be expected to wear more construction appropriate clothes when they physically wont do any work on site? There is also likely a business casual drss code in the office so it\\'s not like they\\'ll just change to come to site. \\n\\nI get it\\'s annoying wearing PPE all the time, especially for drywallers and finish carpenters but you are just getting yourself worked up over something that really doesn\\'t affect you at all. Where you at u/Julieg21234? This guy is talking about you and your goofy employer. wow that looks super dangerous.. Stairway to Heaven Where is the fucking tag line?\\n\\nYou don\\'t need your hand on it, and you can keep it from bouncing off the walls.\\n\\nIsn\\'t a tag line mandatory where you work? Why is it when something dangerous is being hung and moved, I just gotta put my hand on it? Wow, I would not get under that thing. so alot more dangerous work to come... stay safe plz This belongs on r/sweatypalms Looks like a unique job to be on. But please get them to throw a tag line on. I would hate to see someone get hurt from an uncontrolled load. I am demoing concrete stairs at my current job and if we could do this, it would have saved a month in our schedule. Instead we have three guys and a chipping hammer. May I ask why? I thought it was a r/whatcouldgowrong and I was expecting the person to end really poorly, but it is not. Good for them! If that concrete snaps, the bloke standing there is as good as fucked. I wouldn‚Äôt be doing that personally, it‚Äôs too long a length of concrete, kudos if you managed it though. Would recommend a second fixing point, with shortened chain at the top side of stair. Alot of load in one spot doing in the way you\\'ve done it. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t lift precast stairs like that, so definitely wouldnt trust old ones You are one brave SOB standing anywhere near that while it‚Äôs going out. I‚Äôd be crapping my pants Why not use a bridle hitch with two connection points instead of one? Is this a crane or a helicopter?  You said ‚Äúflew‚Äù in your title, but ‚Äúcrane‚Äù in the comments.  Helicopter would explain no tax lines, as I believe they‚Äôre not allowed when using a helicopter. How are you certain that the stairs can be lifted from one point without them breaking in half?\\n\\nHonest question! Curious about the considerations being made prior to attempting it. The only time I\\'ve ever done blind picks (20-ish years ago) the crane company had a policy about using visual signals only, no radios. Ended up needing to daisy chain signals through three guys for a few hours to get it done. Went smooth, but made me really worried being the last signal guy in the chain and directing the operator to do something I couldn\\'t see myself. I don‚Äôt like the way he stood under that at times, and he had room to move.  Unnecessary risk No tag line? Where the fuck is the tag line As a signaler, if this is this guy\\'s full time job, he could do better. His language could be more consistent, he could gtfo of the way, tag line(s) etc. oh so your gutting the building? They are like the pirate-bikers of the industry no?\\nLast time we had roofers they rolled up in a black primer coated pickup right out of MadMax they seemed fearless Here in MA roofers go all winter long. Just work around the snow days. Was the same when I lived in WI. Here in the UK they would have to have scaffold edge protection at a minimum. Unless the parapet wall is a minimum of 1100mm.\\n\\nIf that can\\'t be achieved then a temporary mansafe system should be installed so they can harness up.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t look safe at all. The weather this past week or two has been pretty mild. Christmas Day was almost 55*. Half of my friends that are used to being laid off by now are still getting overtime. It‚Äôs been a weird ‚Äúslow‚Äù season so far. Hell I preferred roofing in northern winter\\'s to the summer. Here in Iowa, we‚Äôve seen 2 really bad snow storms and they were both in late October lmao. Otherwise it‚Äôs been nothing but 30s-50s in December. All the construction workers are out and have jobs, usually dead around this month and early next month, like no roofers anywhere siders, or framers, but we are all up and working like it‚Äôs summer. Where is the flagging or fall protecting?! Just finished a roof yesterday in Ontario. Shit\\'s cold, bruh. Shouldn‚Äôt they be tied off that close to the edge? Great looking building - to bad it needs that fire escape that has such a visual impact. Illinois flat roofer here. We work every day we can through winter Mexicans and the Amish can walk on roofs like I‚Äôve never seen anyone before. No fear Might be warmer winters.... Sadly. Looks like Clifton. Too much economic improvement in Ohio to stop working That means, roofers only have 2 days holiday on Christmas? Roofing in the winter is so much more comfortable than in the summer, in texas at least. You stay warm from working. It\\'s just so gd hot up there in the summer. In Arizona you can see bumper stickers that say  ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for beer, roofers would rule the world‚Äù.  Summer roofing projects in that heat produce a special type of worker. They have earned my respect. They just dress for the weather. Idk about in Ohio but in Illinois it was in the 60‚Äôs last week. Weather was beautiful. Where‚Äôs the fucking harness??? We roof year round here in Canada. Fucking global warming... We\\'ve got roofers running year round in NY those guys are troopers Im sorry? You take the winter off down there in ohio? *chuckles in safety manager write up voice* How do guys have the strength/energy to lift weights after working a physically hard job in the trades 5-7 days per week? I\\'m not talking about office jockey \"construction workers\". Like a mason or a roofer, how the heck can they work out *after* work? Why are they dressed like they\\'re on a gay porn set?  Never trust the overly ripped dude on a job site.  Flip side of that coin is never be the skinny lanky dude on a job site. You should shake the camera some more. this is so underupvoted. You realize the purpose of body training is so your body gets stronger not weaker lol I saw this coming from the other side of the planet. How did this guy not realise what was about to happen? I will never not carry a role of shop towels in my truck with me to have while on construction sites. The quality of toilet paper in the job site toilet should actually be illegal. Plumber here and these are NOT flushable , maybe they pass the toilet but they are gonna stuck and clogg in the pipes I typically carry blue shop towels and a handful of plastic grocery bags to dispose the used ones in. The toilets at my job sites are usually a copse of trees. Oh, and a bar of dial soap. Lol\\n\\nI keep them in my glove box. I don\\'t flush them though because half our jobsites are on septic and nothing goes in unless it specifies \"septic safe\" on the packaging! When it comes to keeping my junk dry, I\\'ve gone for quantity over quality.\\n\\nStopped buying Gold Bond and for the same money buy 4 bottles of generic baby powder.\\n\\nOne in the tool box, one in the truck, one in the office, one in the porta john.\\n\\nIf it\\'s over 80 and sunny I\\'m powdering up all day long.

My coworker killed one by dropping it in the lake. I was so upset. Both of those are underneath my back seat at all times. The poop issue is the toughest thing in my job. I wish there was another solution. I even thought of wearing Depends lol. I spy a miluakee user Sometimes looks suspect walking into a terlet stall with my bag Missing diapers for when you pull ground wire....üòâ Who else here team Milwaukee?\\n\\nYou can downvote me. [deleted] The best part about that,  The same asshats that decide you need to sit through a 2 hour orientation to do a 3 hour job, are the first ones that will walk through that tape. You\\'ve successfully prevented everyone from walking through it except perhaps Catherine Zeta Jones. I spray foam and have actually had to remove a guy in charge of safety on a new medical lab with very strict safety rules.  The jackass walked through my red danger tape with a sign saying Proper respiratory protection required, then cut through the plastic I taped over the door opening so we could keep it properly ventilated   Idiots are everywhere I\\'m a floorlayer and this is standard for ensuring people stay off glue or wet patch. And somehow still....footprints... It‚Äôs been my experience that even with all that tape, someone will find a way. I don‚Äôt know how, but they do... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh! More tape for me to cut through! I don‚Äôt wanna go the long way.  Oh so relatable today, I was sealing a concrete stairwell floor, keeping the industrial look I suppose. Well the tile guy decides to run up the stairs despite me having tape up, and my bright yellow ass standing there with a wet floor. \\n\\nThankfully the GC showed up in time to yell at him so I wouldn\\'t have to. And this also being the same guy that yelled at my coworker for stepping on one of his wet tiles that wasn\\'t closed off earlier on the job. Every. Fucking. Time. \\\\*Guilty\\\\*\\n\\nA few months ago the walk way to a leasing office was caution tapped off that wasn\\'t there when I first arrived. I needed a signature to bill them for the minor work I did on the property.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see anything dangerous, so I just stepped under it and went on into the leasing office.\\n\\nA few steps into the leasing office I almost slip, I look down and finally realize, the walkway was being painted. I tracked paint shoe prints halfway through the leasing office.  I took off my shoes apologizing profusely, calling myself a dumb ass.  crumpled up the invoice and left out the side entrance in my socks.  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B; Was on a job site today demoing concrete and asphalt at a 7/11 gas station on the corner of a busy street, the whole thing was fenced off except one entrance. We had 4 dump trucks, 2 skids and 2 mini ex\\'s running inside the small space and people kept walking in or driving in to grab something from the store.  I was working in top of a parking garage and had set up orange barriers to block off the top level while we went to lunch. We came back and people had got out of their car and moved them to park up there.  I don\\'t see the danger. I probably would have just cut that crap instead of walking way the hell around... Nice message, but construction workers are still working right now, and we use these same respirators. The shortage is affecting us too. If anyone in the trades has these masks they are using using them for themselves, since back order is over 2 months for this stuff.\\n\\nEdit: Our supplier just informed us to not expect anymore masks or filters for the rest of the year. We have a homeless family ready to move into the place we\\'re working on the minute we\\'re done and we\\'re working without protection.\\n\\nWe need to protect health care workers. I used to be a nurse, I agree.\\n\\nBut I\\'m really sick of people asking me to give up something that I don\\'t have, assuming that I don\\'t need it. And isn\\'t housing for a homeless family just as important to stop the spread of the virus? My state health department says it\\'s critical. So I go to work without PPE because doctors and nurses are heroes but blue collar workers just don\\'t matter, even when we\\'re contributing to the solutions.\\n\\nIf I actually find some masks, I\\'m sure as fuck going to use them. Guys on our job site (concrete) can‚Äôt even find masks anywhere. What pisses me off is seeing random people walking around the streets with them on. These are people simply going about their daily routine, not healthcare workers or construction workers.\\n\\nI hope the people in public wearing masks feel safe in their minds while the guys building the medical facilities are getting silicosis. Or the healthcare staff are getting sick from treating corona patients. Fuck off, I was up in this crusty ass attic for 7 hours the other day and we had no masks cause of this bullshit I work as a film carpenter. We got shut down a few weeks ago and our union has been organizing and donating masks and other things (gloves, literally hospital gear from hospital shows like hand sanitizer) but I do worry that when we go back to work we wont have anything. I get priorities, but  sure hope I have a spare set of cartridges for my mask somewhere in my kit.... Another thing to note about these is that you can very easily halve your filter usage by sealing off one cartridge inlet and just using one cardtridge or filter at a time. It‚Äôs not the best way to use it but if you are using the filters as one offs it‚Äôs an option to prolong how many you have I know a couple construction companies that aren‚Äôt donating their PPE since they‚Äôre still working and don‚Äôt want to catch an OSHA violation i was lucky enough to get a P95 3M respirator by pure chance at home depot like 3 days ago. they had like 2 left because someone returned them (wtf?). sealed in a bag so brand new, never opened. Deleted Lawn care and landscaping business owner here, we need the masks in our work too and having trouble finding them... OP, nothing wrong with your post.\\n\\nBut it makes me reflect on how fucked this presidents preparation for and response to this pandemic is. \\n\\nPeople serving others, people are dying, and people are sacrificing and he\\'s busy inserting personal tax dodges into the relief bill ..... MF. [deleted] I have a few(2), and I\\'m not working, . However, I can totally see bringing them in and some hospital authority throwing them out because \" they aren\\'t new\"  or \" not the right specs. Do you think that would happen? I\\'m really really poor and the idea of me giving away something very valuable to me just to have it thrown away, makes me worry. I have at least 20 from when I did some home remodeling. \\n\\nCalled a couple hospitals in DC and they said they didn\\'t want them as they couldn\\'t verify they were unused/clean. \\n\\nGuess there staying in my basement. I should mention that as a construction worker, in Canada at least, I have the right to refuse unsafe work. That can mean a lot of things but in this case, if you are not being provided the proper PPE to do a job safely you have the right to refuse to do it with no fear of penalty. Your employer cannot fire you if you say to them you are unwilling to insulate an attic without a proper respirator. End of discussion. If the health care workers require the respirator more than the engine of a country then so be it. SHUT DOWN!!! Both are important but they are very different. For context: a respirator and a mask are two different things, what is pictured and being talked about is a mask, a wearable passive air cleansing device. What is being talked about that hospitals need to save lives are respirators, machines that actively push and pull air and basically breathe for someone that‚Äôs lungs are too weak. Eye protection? You mean safety squints? #wear your respirator. \"...And don\\'t forget to bring a towel.\" There, fixed it for ya! üëç nice Congratulations! Congratulations man!! Very nice. Most people are just complacent with the position they\\'re in for as long as they can. Completely undervalued themselves and are scared to ask for more money as well. When I hire people I ask them what they want to make. Most people still under sell themselves. I want to pay someone who knows what they\\'re worth. Can you tell us more about the position and what kind of company is it? What experience/certs did they consider?\\n\\nCongratulations! I\\'m happy for you Right on! Congrats bud! Work hard and it‚Äôll pay off! Right on! Congratulations and best of luck. Congrats my man! Keep asking for more! I would up vote but....niiice Good for you. Lots of people get complacent. In their role, and in the roles of the people working for them. Some of them even actively try to keep you in a role that\\'s just a stepping stone for you, not a career goal. Friend of mine wanted to move to another division in another state, in his same company, and his boss actively tried to keep him down. He had to go over that boss\\' head to get it done. That sort of thing happens too much, and no one should ever stand for it.\\n\\nOnwards and upwards, good luck to you. Get it! Saw a fire truck drive into the job across the street from mine. Hope whoever it was for gets to drive home tonight. This shit ain\\'t worth dying over. Really drives the point of safety home hearing stories like this so close to home. Safety is a culture and we are all in a brotherhood union or not.  Be safe out there guys. Wear that ppe bros. Getting the job done ain\\'t worth your life. I catch myself doing sketchy shit all the time. This is a sobering reminder that tragedy can happen at any point to anyone. Really really sad to hear. This is in my backyard. From what I have heard BP refinery is really strict on safety, doesn‚Äôt really matter how it happened, all that matters is this man went to work, and never came home. Sad however you want to look at it We just had a guy last week fall from 5ft off a ladder during a wire pull and fractured his pelvis with internal bleeding. He‚Äôs gonna be ok but still very humbling.... we are not invincible.  Stay safe everyone Fuck.  \\n\\n\\n23... fuck. Had a first year apprentice fall from a scaffold pulling wire last year, he survived but is paralyzed from the neck down. Always look out for yourself when someone tells you to do something uncomfortable. Speaking of PFAS. What is the most comfortable one to wear? \"those who are green\" what does that mean üôè the article says 2011 Looks pretty safe to me. Also pretty fun [deleted] That gave me a heart attack! I didn‚Äôt see the crane... At least the operator is wearing a hard hat and hi vis vest... Props to the operator. Saw the collapse before anyone else did.... How is a wrecking ball not an option, even just a giant piece of metal rigged to the crane to use as a wrecking ball would be simpler and safer. So cool, one long reach excavator would have done it well but this seems alot more fun It\\'s ok! He has his harness on! Bucket laser best laser. Annnnd spot the foreman  I know these have been around a long time and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs completely safe but... nope! Is that quickstop and sawdust between the piles 3-4 FT below water level to get the seal?   This is a confined space? Also to get in and out wouldn\\'t you need fall protection to get in and out?\\n The health and safety standards in the states always astound me. Could pick a dozen violations from this photo!  $10.00 says the concrete guys get it out of square! lol  That‚Äôs awesome. My company is in the process of bidding for a 1million+ sq ft warehouse!

I\\'ve done a couple $100M plus Why is the mesh in the bottom of the slab? Incredible Is that the one going up right off of Preston near 380? Is there a vapor barrier under that slab? I have a question on getting the concrete panels to build the warehouse.  Do they form the panels at the site and then lift them in place or do they ship them in? Welcome to Dallas! I‚Äôm in construction in Dallas also.  Jesus christ, before looking at the title I thought this was a runway outside an airport or something! I do install at fire safety solutions in Farmers Branch. strong chance they‚Äôll contract us so i may see ya there!  There‚Äôs tons of em going up around here Nice rebar work. Looks good.

What\\'s the eave/peak roof heights and the slope? ...can you cut tensioned cabling like that within a slab? How does that work? Precast guy here and we usually just use quick cuts for this and it‚Äôs a pain in the dick Looks like ineffective fall protection. It\\'s nice sometimes when you can just get the job done without someone screaming \"FIRE WATCH! WHERE\\'S YOUR FIRE WATCH!\" No water? Were the planks left long intentionally or are you fixing an error? Beauty picture I hope you were wearing your safety glasses when you took this These are hollowcore slabs right? Thanks , makes it easier then cutting it while hanging  prior to dropping in . Nice shot ! I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúpost tensioned ‚Äú cables blow !  You‚Äôre right . They can kill you.

Did you score cut first or just go full depth right away? Badass cranes I can see that tower from the tower I\\'m working. \\n\\nIf a tower like that one needs to be demolished how do they do it? Floor by floor? Who‚Äôs the GC and major subs?  Any insider stories from the project?  Major problems / unique design etc I wonder, is it safer to have the booms straight up during offtime? I could see it preventing some strain in certain places, but also creating it in others.. Anybody have any info regarding such? That\\'s some glorious \\'essential\\' work.. What‚Äôs up Toronto! I drive by this building all the time on the way to my site. Ahhhh this is 81 Bay Street , I was there for the last 10 months , it was a shit show walking up all those stairs when the hoists were down ; people still working at this  job site during corona ? Yikes Terrible non existent transition from deck rail to stair rail.  Definitely appears to exceed 4\". Stairs? *Sure but they didn‚Äôt say anything about them having a landing or not finishing in the middle of the yard.* [deleted] I love flaunting code violations looking for praise too. Either you‚Äôre a clueless homeowner or a hack contractor. Smh looks nice af, but I can\\'t really tell, because of the sod, if that has a poured concrete base. Without that, you\\'re basically relying on the top attach point to hold all the weight. I like to secure both top and bottom, so it sort of wedges itself in the pocket between the two. Makes that stuff last damn near forever. Also needs risers to make sure you can\\'t trip. I\\'m basing everything I\\'m saying off of code for my area. still nice work tho *Looks* great. I\\'m not sure your local code but you definetly need a landing if you\\'re going that many steps in one shot.\\n\\nEDIT: OP, take all these comments as constructive as you can. Not meant to dig at you. If I was inspecting this or building it I\\'d review a few key components to the design.\\n\\n1) Check that ledger ensure its lag bolted solid.\\n\\n2) Strong tie hangars on every joist.\\n\\n3) That\\'s a long span on your fascia/beam. You want that to be 2x10 or 2x12 doubled or trippled up. On point load connection with carriage bolts.\\n\\n4) Stairs. Those are too much of a risk. \\n    You want a solid footing, that way you can tapcon a piece at the bottom step (cutaway on the stringer) acts like a brace to avoid it ever sliding or moving out from under. Too many steps for a single flight. Few steps up to a landing then continue from landing to second story. The only thing I like is the grass. The only thing. \\n\\nGood god is that house ugly.\\n\\n The posts on the bottom are not actually on the bottom--that\\'s dumb. And the mid span posts are not even mid span between the stupidly located bottom posts and the top posts.\\n\\nThe hand rail around the deck is not contiguous with the handrail going down the stairs.\\n\\nThe lack of risers is disconcerting and wouldn\\'t fly where I am at.\\n\\nThe span is too long without a landing.\\n\\nAnd there is a piece of blue tape stuck to the siding. wtf. A lot of steps there. I do not like it. lets post the illegal staircase I built and would be liable for if someone died on the interwebs! look guys I did a good job! OP stop trying to justify the fact that there is no pad for the stairs...you are a hack plain and simple. Would of dropped the railing one step down rather than up My two pennies. Not a deck builder, but understand decks. \\n\\n1. Should there be any cross bracing on the deck joiist underneath?\\n2. Should there be a third post in the middle for the deck?\\n3. Are the deck post the right size?\\n4. What are the deck (and stair) post resting on? Does it go below the frost line?\\n5. In just looking at the deck, it looks good, but something tells me it‚Äôs far from code. I‚Äôd be interested to see the ledger board and how it is fastened. As well, the post connections too at the top. \\n6. Not even a concrete pad at the base????\\n7. In my area, that run is allowed to go without needing a landing. 17 is the max. \\n8. The first step doesn‚Äôt match the rest. \\n9. The hand rail is interrupted on the stair. \\n10. Aesthetically, attaching the rail to the house is not pleasing to me. I‚Äôd imagine this goes against code though. Needs its own post right, be able to support 200lb of lateral force?\\n11. Did he seal the stringer after cutting?\\n12. What‚Äôs up with the two rim joist boards on the front of the deck? aaand lets just run this staircase into the fuckin lawn down there aaand.. done! specialist style üòé [deleted] I\\'m surprised that nobody\\'s talking about the span of the cut stair stringers. The max. span of a cut 2x12 isn\\'t specified in IRC, but it is specified that the stairs have to support a load of 40 psf. IIRC, a cut 2x12 stringer spaced at 18\" can only have a max span (measured horizontally) of about 6 ft. I know that he\\'s doubled up the exterior stringers, but the two interior stringers aren\\'t doubled and they carry more of the load than the exterior ones. I\\'m pretty sure if you actually did an analysis of these stairs, they wouldn\\'t support 40 psf. These steps make me worry what the flashing at the ledger board looks like as well as the hidden girder. There are stair railings but I don\\'t see a continuously graspable handrail? Along with other\\'s observations, how did this pass inspection? [deleted] I would have gone with \"Firepole\" I would be so upset if that was my house. No way in hell this has a permit associated with it. \\n\\nI just put more structure under a deck I\\'m building with a buddy that\\'s 1\\' off the ground ffs. This just looks irresponsible. Da fuck? All things said I still would have built the stairs on the other side of the deck if I were you. lol Good work mate! It looks aesthetically very pleasing but if we consider the construction point of view, like safety standards, I still believe that rail could be extended to the bottom tread. \\n\\nBut in case all the residents are healthy and fit, I don‚Äôt think anyone would mind that rail not reaching the last step. Moreover, I could understand how last-minute additions to an already existing project could feel. \\n\\nGood Luck!  :) More impressed by the railing! Also, I don‚Äôt do concrete. I‚Äôll let them figure it out Update for expected criticism: Sides are doublers. I was worried I would need a crossbrace in the middle (+2 footings to dig and pour), but after removing my temp purlin they feel super solid. Had a 350lb coworker jump in the middle with very little variance. Terrain is the hardest/dryest clay I‚Äôve ever dug so I think the bottom is fine. Concrete pad was not in my bid to GC I\\'m aware there are issues, but I couldn\\'t do better myself yet. So I will give an A for effort. Nice work! I‚Äôve done similar sets of stairs same situation. Customer is always right! That sells for 150k here in NYC just like the banana In the dead of winter the framing nails bunch together for warmth. They will remain motionless unless disturbed by a Cat‚Äôs Paw. [deleted] Target practice. Must be a sheer wall.. Someone hammered as much of a coil as would stay into a wall. That‚Äôs what happens when there‚Äôs a spider crawling on the framing. Nailed it!! It‚Äôs called art Drywallers will get it Went to the site and got hammered. Dialing in a nail gun or teaching someone to do the same? That‚Äôs called a gang nail üòÜ Never laughed so hard just reading comments haha Time for an angle grinder with a cutoff disk. , l nfd*ck!?!?!??, c6   is 4 in km no. Looks like they marked the stud to plane down, just want to make sure they dull the heck out out of the portaplaner Nice shooting Tex Someone doesn‚Äôt like the Boardman. I\\'m greatly disappointed that there is not someone\\'s hammer or nail bar under all those suckers Cause fuck the drywallers, that\\'s why... I used to nail like 4-5 nails in a clump if I was too lazy for a ladder... Totally safe no worries everything turned out okay I hate it when carpenters don\\'t hammer nails in all the way Looks like something I‚Äôve done. We were in the testing phase so I was just chilling waiting for them to need my help so I drove every spare screw I could find into an extra junction box I had. Just making sure the hammer still works üëç This is the work of someone who quit. \"Art\" Nail orgy The same vibe with poking a whole on an eraser Just adding value Maybe a spider there or something\\n\\nEdit: Was* [deleted] This is precisely my wife using every single power tool we own.  She\\'s not exactly safety conscious, and really doesn\\'t want to hear about it.  At least they‚Äôre wearing goggles.  Dang...so close to the holidays. That‚Äôs quite a load on the shoulders of the new helper too.  I\\'ve been doing construction for so long that I forget that it\\'s still a dangerous business. Thanks for the reminder, it\\'s a good wake up call. Jesus. What a terrible scene to witness. Prayers to everyone involved and the family of course. The most important thing to know about a machine is how to shut it down. Sorry for your loss. Condolences. Not sure about the rules but if there is any type of fund for the worker\\'s family, please post it here or pm me. Stay safe out there.  I\\'m so sorry for your loss. :(\\n\\nRemember everyone, the Site Safety Officer is your friend, not your enemy. Please do what they request, they just want you to go home to your family. Sorry to hear that. How is helper holding up? Last year or the year before right before Christmas I was digging shallow test holes at a project and a drill rig was doing the deeper holes that I couldn‚Äôt dig down to. The driller was bundled up for the cold weather and his helper walked away from the rig to shoot the shit with the soils engineer. In that time his clothing got caught up in the rig and the rig tore him up. Even with a off duty fire fighter on site he passed before the ambulance could get there. The machines we deal with will tear through rock, snap trees and deal with abrasive materials all day. They don‚Äôt know the difference between dirt and flesh. Alway be aware of your surroundings. Our area had a fatality this last spring that was that same thing.  Directional drill rig near where he was putting up tiebacks and something happened.\\n\\nPTOs, drill rigs, paving machines... always be extra careful around the heavy stuff.\\n\\nMy condolences to you and his family. Im sorry for your loss of a team member, sending thoughts and prayers your way. can someone come up with clothing that tears away easy?  better to be stripped naked than dead. no? There was a drilling accident here in Alaska today with a death also. Very sad.  damn bro...\\n\\nI worked for a tree company for one month until there was not enough work. Within couple of months, I read about a teenager getting sucked into the tree shredder; the boss was his father and he had a heart attack on that scene. Brutal\\n\\nGot a call for my first outside line work as a groundman, crushed my finger on my 4th day. Shit was demoralizing and it took me a year until I got another call to work.\\n\\nBe safe y\\'all Fuck, sorry to hear. My condolences.  Oil worker here too. Terrible news. My sincere condolences  Condolences. I heard about a kid that got himself tangled up into a pipe threader around this time last year around me. Wearing a hoodie with the really thick drawstrings dangling and pulled him in.  I pave roads. Just yesterday one of our laborers got hit with a skid steer and shattered both legs and one of our truck drivers fell out of the bed of his truck while spraying it with diesel and tore a ligament in his shoulder. Always gotta stay alert and take your time.  Was that at Milne Point? It‚Äôs terrible to hear.  Damn, I\\'m sorry. My condolences. This just reminds me how lucky I‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve seen some bad accidents and involved in one. We were all lucky enough to go home, \\n\\nTake care of yourselves and your coworkers, especially if your company can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt.  During my job this summer I got injured and had five staples to my head and came close to being crushed by scaffolding too. It‚Äôs a dangerous field and safety is always an issue. Another coworker of mine lost two fingers from an accident so understand why companies take safety so seriously.  That would go great on my Ryobi cordless  Nice! that little hilti (dd350?) looks a little out of place. thought you guys were all about the hydro? Safe to say you are going to hit some rebar lol The bit is kinda impressive, but look at those blades in the background! \"Whats that block you\\'re putting a 2 inch hole in? Oh nevermind, that\\'s the bit\" ... I\\'m trying to figure out how much that bit costs ‚Äú*Iiiiiiii like big bits and I can not lie*‚Äù That custom set up for the drill is nice yes but will it fit in my honda? Why even bother installing a floor if you\\'re just gonna cut half of it off Hello fellow ccutter! How did your hold go? Is that a husky and a 35horse corecut I see there?\\n\\nWhere you based bro The stains and discolorations are beautiful. Like an art piece I‚Äôm pretty sure even my DeWalt 60v FlexVolt still won‚Äôt handle that. üòÇ Fake: didn\\'t see a single crackhead on that crew Omg this is so hard core and dramatic. I love it. I know the firms ive worked with check all media released, even things like workers not wearing long sleeves can ruin an otherwise amazing shot. [deleted] I can smell it It\\'s funny how slomo can make things so dramatic This is incredible footage! What are you using to capture? Post-processing? Yeh you\\'re right, upto them! I was hoping to see the finished product. Still a bad ass video üëç Why does it remind me of coffee beans What did you use for this? What device/program? Looks great Good ole d dog Looks like everyday for me. I love it I love the aesthetic of dirty grimy machinery still just churning away. I always loved driving the skid steer at work. I\\'d actually like to try my hand at asphalt.  There\\'s a lot of work out there for it. For the love of god, make them diesel the gates! Dope vid!! Are those guys meant to be wearing more safety gear? Corporates wouldn\\'t use such footage if that\\'s the case. /safety inspector has joined the game Looks like Colorado It\\'s a big snowball about the size of a big snowball Didn\\'t film it rolling into the road? NVM I\\'m super high it shattered Montana? Big Sky area? And then there‚Äôs regular joes like me who make giant dicks with their footsteps in the parking lot. Okanagan Valley B.C. Okanagan Valley B.C. Now we need fire extinguishers at the hand washing stations... FML. Cool, now we\\'re gonna have to fill out a hot work permit every time we hit the hand san dispenser Nothing I didn\\'t know but I\\'ll definitely be more aware of ESD possibly igniting hand sanitizer from now on, thanks for sharing I\\'d just received this and thought to pass it on; identifying information removed. You‚Äôre not on fire, Ricky Bobby ! We used to douse our hands in rubbing alcohol and light it with a lighter This is very interesting and I wonder how statistically significant. You can put ‚Äúflammable‚Äù on the product all day, everyone knows that. What most people DON‚ÄôT know is that static electricity could ignite it.  They should cover all sources of static electricity with these labels. Oh no, this is like poking yourself in the eye while putting on safety glasses... makes me wonder if zero incidents is even possible. I burned my.hand like that in high school.... Thaut it would be Kool by pouring  the Bunsen burner alcohol on my hand and then lite it....it was the 80s teenager trying to reproduce a MTV music video scene, what could go wrong..... \"Kill it with fire.\" 70-90% alcohol is flammable.. this obvious I‚Äôve seen some dumb shit on the internet. This will be filed in that same cabinet This sub is becoming my favorite one, the quality of posts has really gone up Not a cheap pull I haven\\'t seen a dolly like that used before, does the dozer have an air supply for the trailer brakes?

It may seem a bit pricey but it can be the best and safest way to do things. Nice setup, gotta get creative sometimes. What\\'s the purpose of the totes? We used some this summer to create the main body of a levee for a stream diversion to complete a pour in place box culvert. Really enjoyed the utility of them. The safety guy hates you. we used to be able to use earbuds on 1 side, but some dumbass on site got his headphones ripped into the table saw. Typically they don‚Äôt want headphones onsite because they want you to be able to hear, so a sup would probably still say something Shhh. You‚Äôre gonna spoil it for us. No music devices of any kind.. headphones.. radio.. truck speakers, etc... \\n\\nWe are required to wear ear protection.\\n\\n These would work better for me then putting a random sparkys company name on my radio and listening to that. Don\\'t listen to OP. This is the worst advise. You need to be aware of your surroundings on a job site. You will not hear anyone trying to get your attention if something is about to cause you harm or you\\'re about to walk off an edge. Good way to get killed [deleted] [deleted] I work industrial construction and your hearing would be shot to shit in a week with those things. And the safety guy is gonna love you for actually having your ear plugs on I\\'ve used my active noise canceling earbuds on a job working in a pre-fab shop. Didn\\'t even have them plugged into anything. Just had them on, they have a battery. From Phillips. Worked fucking great, you could other people waaaay better. Killed off a lot of the 60 hz hum everything electrical seems to put off. Killed a lot of back ground noise. They have rubber earpads, I just took them off, cut off the top two domes of those triple dome ear safety plugs. They have a little hole in the middle for inserting the lanyard that were easy enough to get over the earbuds post. They plugged my ear better, came in orange. Safety guy looked at them and never said a word about them. They just looked like they were on a lanyard. The battery back on the earbud lanyard I had under my work shirt. Check these out ...Awesafe Ear Protection for... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BS9SXSS?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share Nice headphone jack Oh fuck yeah thank you haha Can I get a link op I have full cover electronic shooting ear protectors that when they are on you can adjust the volume to hear low decibel sounds like voices and when the level goes over 82db it cuts the noise out ...Amazon has them for 40 bucks and you can also plug your phone in them to listen to music To the people saying your gonna die. No. Use common sense, google mike Rowe‚Äôs safety third. Just put your phone on like half volume and put it in your hard hat. It amplifies it enough to hear it when not doing something really loud and it‚Äôs nothing in your ears for the safety guy to bitch about. As a GC for me these are just great. If you get hurt I\\'ll just say I thought it was hearing protection, or later if I decide I dont like you I\\'ll just use them as an excuse to send you home. Your company will say you didnt follow the rules laid out in your contract, and in the contract they signed with my company. Then they will terminate you for cause. But hey, at least you got to listen to Pantera while you lumped pavers. Do they sound any good? NICE...... thanks for the heads up brah. F the safety Nazis on here. I have been doing this for over 20 years 99% of injuries are self inflicted by stupidity. I know this project and this exact location. I‚Äôll upvote for that lol. Any chance you know where to get that soft brim for the hard hat I could use one of them for the summer Birmingham 59/20 bridge work! Safety sombrero? Vermiculite. In our market (MN) 3/4 of the vermiculite has asbestos in it as it came from a single mine in MT. We don\\'t bother testibg it, we treat it all as asbestos. Maybe other areas of the country it is a lower percentage but I wouldn\\'t touch it again until it was tested.\\n\\nAny half way competent contractor is gong to have a \"hidden conditions\" clause in their contract, which this would fall under. If your boss says don\\'t worry about it, don\\'t give in. You see those none stop Mesothelioma adds? Who do you think gets it? Hint: people who worked with asbestos! Looks like vermiculite. Vermiculite. Asbestos, gtfo. Option 1: If it tastes like pepper, you struck the pepper gold mine. Proceed to package and sell\\n\\nOption 2: If it tastes like asbestos, ask yourself how you know what asbestos tastes like, then proceed to package and sell as pepper.\\n\\nOption 3: Put a scoop of it in an abandoned mine with an apprentice. If the apprentice survives the night, package and sell as pepper.  \\n\\nAll options allow you to start a lucrative small business.  You‚Äôre set for life pal.  \\n\\nPS. Treat it like it‚Äôs radioactive. Secure the area, call for a test. Keep area secured until you know what you‚Äôre dealing with. I‚Äôve come across this as a supervisor. I made a poor decision and told the labour‚Äôs to go away while I cleaned it up. I used an emulsifier to make it safe. But I still likely contaminated myself. Not worth it. Follow protocol.\\n\\nEdit: also taste that plaster stucco stuff on the cinder block.... Vermiculite.  DO NOT blow on it or allow it to get into the air, as some vermiculite production was contaminated by asbestos.  It needs to be tested by an accredited lab.  If it\\'s the type without the asbestos, then vacuum it up. If it DOES contain asbestos, then either seal it up, or hire a decontamination company to get rid of it. Not only is the vermiculite dangerous but if what you‚Äôre doing is widening an existing opening, you‚Äôre taking away the header bearing if you destroy the vertical pilaster with the rebar in it. Might want to use shoring if the header stays or the CMU can come down on you unless you knocked it out already. Is this your worksite? You are going to want to get the fuck out of there and not go back. GOLD! You struck gold!\\n\\nKidding, that\\'s vermiculite. Its dangerous, be careful please. Might want to google Libby Montana vermiculite. [Asbestos](https://www.medicinenet.com/asbestos-related_disorders/article.htm#)\\n\\nThis is one article, and there are many.  What you want to avoid is creating dust of anything that could contain asbestos fibers.  Their danger comes from the fact that if inhaled or swallowed, the fibers and embed themselves in epithelial cells.  They are stiff, resistant to chemical breakdown by the body, and cause damage by acting as miniature saw blades that cut the cell every time it moved.  After a while the cell loses its ability to try to heal, and can start on the path towards malfunction and eventually, cancer.  But it can take a long time (and some continued exposure) before there are enough fibers to cause obvious effects.\\n\\nThe best methods avoid creating dust, and if dust is created, then you protect yourself by wearing respirator masks suitable for screening out fine powder. I\\'d say the end of your work in that area until it\\'s tested and most likely remediated. As stated : Vermiculite for insulating Blocks Yea good odds this may contain asbestos, so you should get out ASAP and have this tested. \\n\\nA company I was with years ago had a similar situation (cut into a block wall) and exposed a crew to asbestos. It was a terrible situation for everyone involved! Spider eggs Its a form of insulation. Looks like sand. Its gets poured into the cavities of block walls (old practice) to insulate the wall itself. Hit something similar a couple years ago renovating a governors mansion. Was told it was old fire proofing?

Female project manager checking in for remodeling company! get it ladies! It\\'s happening it just takes time. My wife has gone from a safety assistant to an on-site safety manager in a little over 3 years and is working towards more certifications. The only thing I don\\'t like about it is that there are still old people who think they can act unprofessionally towards her because she\\'s a woman and that shit drives me insane, but then I can\\'t go picking bones with people on the job because it makes my wife look less than capable so I just have to support from the sidelines. I high five the boilermaker Moms hustling and grinding to support their families. It is tough work. I‚Äôm in fourth year electrical school right now and I thought ‚Äúhey, there are a lot of women this year‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs great.  But then I realized it‚Äôs still MAYBE 5% so quite low.  That said I‚Äôve worked with a few women and they‚Äôre totally welcome in my book, I welcome that change. I have several women on my site now, and I guarantee they work harder than these dumb dildos running their mouths on this thread. One of the best operators I‚Äôve ever met worked her way up from (literally) the trenches, and is now a PM and estimator.  I\\'m a little confused when you say that\\'s rare. I\\'ve been in construction since early 00s and worked many projects in many states and each trade had quite a few women in the field. I\\'ve had bosses that are women and been trained by a very intelligent woman on a specific job in my field many years ago. It has never been strange or a focus to see a woman working in any field where I\\'ve personally been.  I‚Äôve worked in the field for 3 years too and we have a framer who‚Äôs a straight lady bad-ass. She does better and more efficient work than most of the guys. ü§ò\\n\\nI also worked for a manager at the start that literally said to me ‚Äúwomen shouldn‚Äôt be doing this type of job.‚Äù I asked him if it was because we were more efficient and flexible than men. I got crickets for an answer. Then the company got acquired and he was NOT invited to stay. Later days and better ways! üëã I\\'m a female and I work in construction tooooo!!! Yesssss girl Hey! Female third year carpentry apprentice here! Don\\'t see many others in the trade (small town, here), but when I do, it\\'s like the [same hat meme](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/6394969856/h471C26EC/). I remember years ago when I was still going through trades school, I had one instructor who really hanmered home the importance of women on site, it went something like;\\n\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúGuys, when you shower and get ready, what do you do? Towel off, pit stick, shave, brush your teeth, comb your hair, get dressed and done, right?‚Äù\\n\\n\\nMost of us nodded in agreement \\n\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúNow think of your girlfriends and how long and how attentive they are to their getting ready ritual. Shower, towel, blow dry, style, pickingclothes and fixing make up, and we all joke that it takes forever, right?‚Äù\\n\\n\\nAgain we all nod. \\n\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúNow think of this, do you want to weld a pipe set up by a guy who pays attention for 10 minutes and calls it good? Or do you want to weld a pipe that was set up by someone who is never happy until its perfect?‚Äù\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my experience women, although not quite at the physical strength threshold of most men, are hilariously more detail oriented and very much ‚Äòit‚Äôs not perfect until it‚Äôs perfect‚Äô types. One welder I met up north, Paige (I think) was the go-to for tig. No one could touch her work, it was, for lack of a better term, beautifully crafted. \\n\\n\\n\\nBut you need all types of people on site. For every rammy mother fucker just slapping shit together for their inches, there‚Äôs those that take the time to perfect the details to make sure it‚Äôs done. It might be a transition point now, but by the time I retire I expect (and hope) for a level field. \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\n\\n\\nWomen are generally more attentive to the details, and every site needs that.  Yup! In my college courses women are starting to fill some seats. Go girls !  My division is about 50/50 I think. Female manager and head office engineer. 1/3 of our REs are female as well. I will say it is usually less for the field personnel. Usually an operator or two. Hopefully the trend continues and more female workers start joining trades.  I work in a construction company and many of us engineers here on head office are female. You can also see a lot of females on construction sites. Well, it‚Äôs given we live on a different country, but the world is getting there. ‚ò∫Ô∏è this gives me hope. i\\'ve been looking into trades as a career option but they all seem pretty male-dominated. i hope i can find an apprenticeship somewhere. i wouldn\\'t want to be unwelcome on a job site or be hired on to fill some quota. I recently got some great literature from my college CM program showing that females in the industry make $.94/1.00 as opposed to the national average of $.78. While it‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs a promising indicator of the growth towards equality. r/casual_female_uprise It is a good thing without doubt, when the woman hired is there to have a go and wants to learn. I\\'ve had the pleasure of working with a few women who were driven, hard working and absolutely not afraid to get their hands dirty and they were exemplary workers. To be clear, I\\'d 100% support hiring more women like that any day of the week. Unfortunately, those women have been in the minority of the women who have been hired in this industry. I\\'ve seen way too many hired for diversity reasons who just drive around all day doing absolutely nothing and still complaining how busy they are or if they had to shift a temp fence panel or something. When assigned a job, they will go and convince someone else to do it. If you ask them for help lifting or something, their back is hurting. If you need them to get their hands dirty, they have to go to the toilet. They will constantly tell people that things are not their job and when things go wrong, make it abundantly clear that they have zero responsibility. That\\'s on top of the sick days once a week, the gossiping and backstabbing, the sleeping with supervisors to get it easy etc. Hiring for diversity alone is bullshit and shouldn\\'t happen. Hiring because someone is actually a good worker or wants to learn to be one is the right way to do it and it\\'s the only way women will find acceptance in the industry. If you\\'re one of the supervisors who hires these women, spend a bit more time on it and make sure they actually want to be there, rather than just grabbing one for diversity sake to keep head office happy. If we hire good quality women employees, it\\'s a fast track to change. If they continue hiring shitty ones, then people will stop hiring them full stop.  WHO GIVES A SHIT there are women on every jobsight I\\'ve ever been on. Just do your job, nobody cares Interior Designer here. I have been working in commercial for 12 years, so I spend a decent amount of time on site.  I‚Äôm usually the only lady.  We need more gals in the field!! \\n\\n(I always have to prove I‚Äôm not an idiot when working with new GCs. I mean, IDs can be super obnoxious, and often times can‚Äôt detail for fuckall. But we aren‚Äôt all morons!) If the job can be done equally by a man or woman then who cares. Get the job done. \\n\\nI do think the ‚ÄúPC‚Äù crowd is a bit ridiculous in ignoring the fact that men and women are built differently though. We are different, and that‚Äôs ok. Why is that so hard to accept? Different genders do things better in certain cases.  Required diversity hiring quotas are the reason. That\\'s great . Women in this field get leniency though don\\'t go believing equality is a 2 way street cuz it still isn\\'t. I see apprentice women do easy ass work because the foreman doesn\\'t trust her frail body to carry a length of 3 inch up a flight of stairs. I ain\\'t trying to shit on you I\\'m letting you know ow that your achievement isn\\'t quite impressive We had a bad weather yesterday. Every woman called in with and excuse, kids needed picking up etc... No guys missed the day. Woman are a liability that needs to be acepted because theor feeling might get hurt. My roommate is a second year carpenter , misses nearly a week each month because of cramps... bring the down votes i don‚Äôt really care. And know ‚Äúrosie the riveter‚Äù quit after a week because the job was hard :(.  Bullshit, there\\'s a guy with a broken arm though. This is actually illegal according to OSHA 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) if you would cancel the next party because someone got injured because it encourages workers not to report safety issues.\\n\\nWhat OSHA would rather see is rewarding people for reporting. For example, completing GOOD JSA\\'s, filling out near-miss reports, identifying unsafe work environments, would be counted towards the next party or raffle.\\n\\n You never wanna be that guy that reports the small scratch on day 199 Without *reported* injury you mean! haha\\n\\nI respect the safety pizza party, I have often done the same with my subs.  Well done! god damn thats a big ass fan! What trade? One of my favorite stories is from an old superintendent of mine, built an entire WTP with no recordables and had a BBQ chicken dinner to celebrate. Someone got a piece of chicken bone lodged in their throat and it resulted in a recordable.  Nice! We just celebrated 365 days yesterday :D Bradfield & Gorrie? Pizza Party!!! https://youtu.be/R7vUBDWyl-Q LIES!... IT\\'S ALL LIES!  Lunch tents are getting super fancy now! There‚Äôs a factory around here that‚Äôs about to hit the 10 year mark without a lost time incident. Pretty impressive.  Beat his ass Dump that old man out of the wheel chair Ive been in spots like this. It was 3am and we were backfilling a gas main we were installing. Some guy drunk out of his mind drove inside our cone patten right along side the trench and almost killed my foreman. Loader operator jumps out, tells the guy to open his door and rips him out of the car and just screams at him pushes him around a little. We had a cop on the job and he was totally understanding, of course the guy was arrested for dui. Guys just because we‚Äôre on the job doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt defend ourselves. In the case of the video the guy could‚Äôve said do you mind moving the ladder for a second? I don‚Äôt do that sort of work but in my experience if we‚Äôre working in the road in front of someone‚Äôs house we drop everything to get them in and out of their driveway safely, stop traffic, put a plate over the trench etc. just be polite, we don‚Äôt want to make your life difficult we‚Äôre just doing our job Isn\\'t that the old dude, Salamanca from Breaking Bad? Call the cops, charge him with attempted manslaughter. You can\\'t be that fucking stupid and get any sympathy from me. Especially when it\\'s obvious he selfishly wanted the ladder moved so he could get by. Fuck that guy. Beat him over the head with my ladder he just broke I\\'d fall feet 1st on the old man... Roll him over into oncoming traffic Holy shit!!! What the hell is wrong with that old man? He needs to be criminally charged and forced into a home. Fuck his daily strolls and piss in his jello! Wheel his bitch ass to the porta potty throw him in there, take his wheel chair. Lock the porta potty and tip it. No porta potty? Throw him in my trunk and figure it out from there\\n\\nEdit: a letter I would have literally beat his face to a Bloody pulp then dragged him up that ladder and throw him off as high as I fell. Fucking old prick I would beat his crippled ass Falcon KICK This is insanely rotten. Coning off the sidewalk would not have stopped him, he was pissed about not being able to get by. He would have thrown those outta the way then done the same thing. man that elder guy didn\\'t give a fucking fuck if he killed someone damn just just damn That dude just landed directly on that ladder with his back and the guy in the white shirt is rubbing his back for him. Idiots all around. I think if I were the guy on the ground I would have hit that old bastard If I was not heading to the hospital, he would be! Disc herniation  for sure,  the old man should \\nknow better. Dang do you think this dude has alzheimers or something? A lot of times old dudes go nuts and get fairly aggressive towards the end when it gets bad. What a fucking prick. This man is out of his mind but fuck are we bad at legal shit If I could get up after that fall, I‚Äôd toss his bitch ass out of his chair like he tossed me off the ladder. I felt it when he grabbed his back after the fall. God can you imagine wondering why you\\'re on the ground and while you\\'re rolling around in pain theres a pissed off old man telling YOU that you\\'re in HIS way! In all fairness, this looked bad all around. \\n\\nNo safety cones. No one on the ground keeping watch. Why was this a good time to do this when there is so much foot traffic? Perhaps all parties involved were short in their planning and execution. Am sure someone was trying to save money and/ or time. \\n\\nWhen i did commercial work we always had extra hands on deck in such situations. \\n\\nThat being said, the old guy deserves a criminal charge. OSHAs gonna wanna see handrails  The craziest part is that this must have been kinda tricky to form so there was obviously some thought put into it. Just really low quality thought apparently.  [I don\\'t care to know why tbh...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tom-delonge-wtf1.gif) That concrete has rebar straight through the middle connecting top to bottom, it\\'s designed to take an Earthquake, even if those supports kick out, the worst that\\'s gonna happen is it\\'ll sag like a wooden rope bridge. \\n\\nJust don\\'t jump up and down on it.  Get back to work I\\'m not paying you to be the health and safety inspector. Who even put up the 2x4 stilts? Like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm not sure if we will be able to save this but let‚Äôs brace it up just in case‚Äù They‚Äôve got posts up under it, looks stable enough to me. As per spec. Just check the engineering sheets. Yep, all good, and you got not 1 or 2 but 3 2x4 vertical bracing, super legit üòú I see nothing wrong with the picture in question Bob the builder did it. That\\'s what they wanted... Bob did it. Me I sorry I need the link to the clip of the appliance guys bringing a fridge up on a hand truck [Story Link](https://13wham.com/news/local/dump-truck-trapped-under-downed-utility-poles-power-lines-in-henrietta)\\n\\nWe currently have 45 linemen out cleaning this up, and they\\'re getting double time too! \"Sir, you can come out of your truck now.  The lines are de-energized.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay.  I\\'ll just stay in here.\" Hey I think I see your problem, the power poles are supposed to be vertical, not at an angle. Just stand them back up again, should be easy.\\n\\n/s Oof.  Mondays.   First the boat now this... rochester is creating a name for itself!  Oh that is bad... Really bad. I wouldn\\'t care if I got fired, I would have shit myself in shame.  That reminds me of a delivery at River Road in Jacksonville.  A mixer truck caught a line coming out of a long driveway and pulled the power line down, catching the neighbor\\'s palm tree on fire.\\n\\n\\nIt was a mess.\\n\\n\\nHe looked like he had about 50 tickets in his hand when I passed him. Are those poles a bit overloaded? I wouldn\\'t think you could take that many down. Fucking Rochester. Work safe, brother! How? That many poles is crazy... did the dude just floor it out of the school or something? So i\\'m not in construction or drive a dump truck, but personally I\\'ve seen quite a bit of dump truck operators drive off sites with the bed still fully up. Is it really not noticeable driving wise when the bed is fully extended, that it could be easily forgotten about?  I can see the backcharges bill now ! Sorry , shit always happens ! Wow. Where do you even start? That article is hilarious! One driver had to make a small detour because the road was blocked. Two more people we\\'re evacuated from the area because they didn\\'t want to stay home.... And three in NOLA. RIP, dude. I‚Äôve had a few close calls, spilled and seen a little blood, but I‚Äôve been lucky to make it 35 years in the trades relatively unscathed. Be safe out there. Turner is one of the most qualified GC‚Äôs out there, but when you work on as many jobs as they do, something‚Äôs bound to happen... Jeesh! Wasn\\'t there a collapse when they were building the casino down there? so sad.. people dont really understand the dangers and the casualties of this work... plz be safe and wary at work.. your family waits for you at home I was teaching a lecture today on casting supported slabs and the importance of the reshoring.  Needless to say, I\\'ve just emailed this to the entire class. Friday, Friday, gotta dig down on Friday\\n\\nsucks bro, what\\'s the afterstory? able to find a valve nearby to shut down? plumber with a concrete saw and an excavator?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nlooks like water & sewer, \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nas somebody who\\'s hit a water line before (and it was in fact on a friday) , call before you dig! Should have gotten out of the machine and done some hand digging! God I hope that\\'s before the meter Gotta love it When I told my father I was thinking about becoming a plumber, he told me there‚Äôs only two things you need to know, 1. Shit flows down hill, and 2. Payday is Friday. \\n\\nGuess he forgot about force mains.  hopefully its all overtime Fresh water 12 inch main. And thankfully it‚Äôs hit fifty degrees today. Better then the -5 earlier in the week. But we dug it up because it was already broken. Lifted the parking lot about 4 inches until we popped it  Nice sneakers.\\n\\nI find when guys cut conrerns on safety, they tend to do it elsewhere as well.\\n\\nNot sure what the story is here though, but call b4 you dig! Sigh...why friday Yep happened to me I take it you don‚Äôt get the automatic double pay for fixing a water main? Former plumber, now videographer! Promotion! It\\'s gonna be a short weekend. Something\\'s fucky That happened to me the other day but it was on a smaller scale. Half inch copper pipe running an inch below the surface of a concrete slab that I was chipping up. The headshake sold it. That‚Äôs got to smell terrible! Looks like some vermiculite fell out? If so, hopefully you watch out / stay safe around asbestos! Aww hell naw... why\\'d you break it? Oh, so there is a place you wont put your finger. My back hurts just watching that. How those guys can tie the mat all day long , without bending their knees . I think they are the strongest men on the site. Man, every part of that job looks like it sucks for your back Some part of me thinks the tool would still be faster overall especially if you had 2 because you can work at a consistent pace. I find it hard to believe that you can hand tie that fast all day long without slowing down significantly. Tbh, this seems like a good task for a robot/ai. It\\'s a very singular goal with a very uniform work environment. That‚Äôs pretty nuts. I‚Äôve used one of those tie guns before and I‚Äôm really impressed how a human can beat them by hand. Rod busters have the hardest physical job on site. Maybe scaffold builders are tied. Mad respect for what they do I think it would be better to say the tool does the job without the physical strain on your body.\\n\\nTheoretically at least. There are many tasks you could do perfectly fine without certain tools, but is just smarter to do with a specific tool. Like bullies. Sure you could throw a heavy object on your back and climb a ladder up to its position, but you risk your safety and if you do it long enough health.\\n\\nI don\\'t know the long time effects of this, but I imagine that using a tool that can do the same thing but on a stick so you don\\'t have to be down might be slower than him, but might keep his back healthier for longer. The union guys around here can barely work with one hand let alone two... Too many narrow spaces for drones. I think AI will take over many jobs, but skilled labor like this is harder to automate than retail or a desk job. Yay snap ties Killer on your pinkie pulling with those side cutting pliers [deleted] I\\'d rock the shit out of those if they came in a safety toe version. I hope his socks and pants are flame retardant because those shoes are straight fire. Look great. But most GCs in our area specifically state in the contracts that all contractor and subcontractor employees must wear work boots with steel toe or safety toe. Safety shoes are prohibited Yeah boi post it to r/sneakers too If those came in 4E wide I would totally rock those. OSHA says work ‚Äúboot‚Äù Residential Super here on east coast, haven‚Äôt missed a day since...\\n\\nCompany applied for multiple exemptions that have been approved by Gov. \\n\\nPeople need their half million dollar houses to settle on time.. \\n\\nIt‚Äôs very essential /s I‚Äôm in the bay working commercial and we are still going. We just had to scale back the crew size. Traveling super. Was working on a commercial project in San Jose. They sent us home about three weeks ago and then laid us off. \\n\\nNow running a multi-family project at home (Southern Utah). Elevator Constructor here in SF. We are still working. I‚Äôm on a affordable housing job. There are lay offs/furloughs In my trade but for the most part we‚Äôre all working. I have a feeling this might change in the next couple weeks.....hoping not but totally understand if they do. Be safe out there everyone. I\\'m in residential in the Midwest. We\\'re working\\n\\nI\\'m glad for the money but some of the work sucks without PPE\\n\\nStopped into the HD for safety glasses the other day and it was a ghost town. Totally freaky. The safety aisle was pretty bare, but they had my glasses We do additions and renovations in Florida. Nobody wants us near their house right now. We also had a renovation in a condo where the HOA put a stop order on all work in the building. That was supposed to be what kept us going for the next 3 weeks. Gives me time to do some projects around the house I‚Äôm curious, I see the majority viewpoint is that construction should stop though I‚Äôm surprised by that since it would mean that everyone would be laid off. I have some money saved up for such a purpose but I hope to never have to use it or apply for unemployment. I also understand that a lot of jobs are not practicing safe measures. \\n\\nMy site was lucky to be early on in the project with small crews and got supplies early so we have good measures unlike a lot of what I am seeing. Even still, I‚Äôm surprised by the overwhelming majority that would rather have all work stop. Am I missing something here? Does everyone just have backup cash to get them through being laid off for a few months? I would appreciate anyone‚Äôs feedback. Residential tile guy here, I was going to try to stay busy in New construction, but now that\\'s dried up, or at least slowed down.  And people are calling about remodels which I told myself I wouldn\\'t do during this thing.  But now I don\\'t know if I can just pass on everything and maybe file unemployment or do what\\'s irresponsible for my community and go after every remodel that comes my way I\\'m an estimator - I\\'m sitting at home all day but we\\'re just working from home now. Double bad. Home is supposed to be my safe space where work doesn\\'t exist!\\n\\nGotta say, though. Those ITB\\'s sure have slowed down. Bah..im in canada.. we got 5 or 7 projects on the go.. yes it\\'s hard to keep track. Not everyone wants to work... some people have to. I have to. I also had to let go of some people....\\n\\nOne guy with a massive drinking/ coke problem\\nOn guy with a drinking problem\\nOne guy that does stuff but you have to re do a lot of it..\\n\\nYeah theas guys had to go no matter what. The work force shortage is ridiculous... we had to let them go because of the lifestyle they led... sketchy friends public transportation and shitty hygiene.. \\n\\nSo now I\\'m doing everything... I got hundreds of hours banked... hopefully its all worth it. I\\'m doing small home Reno\\'s still. Roofing contractor. Starting lots of roofs tomorrow I‚Äôm working commercial but my projects are for the federal government and are funded from national defense funds so they‚Äôve been determined to be mission essential. I\\'m in Western Canada. Our company has loads of work for a while yet. Actually, looking at potentially hiring. My wife wants me to take time off to work on our own place. South east residential man here ..I have been busy between 2 houses (both large projects)  I have a helper a few days a week when needed and it hasn\\'t been too bad for me . One house the customer is a teacher and has been quarantined pretty much since school stopped. And the other home is and has been vacant for a long time so I work alone there which is nice ! When I go to depot , lowes, or the lumber yard I wear my gloves N95 mask and safety glasses for sure . I wash and or sanitize my hands before getting back in the truck trying to limit my exposure.  Thus far I have been blessed with work and health so I\\'ll keep paying the bills as long as I can stay safe. All construction is full steam ahead in Australia. Could change in the next couple weeks, but no one has said anything about it yet. We are doing split start and break times as well as social distancing, one person per vehicle etc. Gyms, cafes, restaurants etc closed. Most office workers doing it from home. Traffic has been great! Most are glad to still be working, but also pretty scared about the virus. Lot of older blokes, smokers, overweight etc people in construction in Australia, so if it did get into the industry, it would be really bad. Commercial foreman are working in the bay Commercial super in the midwest. We\\'re not slowing down yet! Commercial east coast. Still working. PM for high end spec home builder in Houston.  Still have boss and clients pushing like crazy for closings.  We had already over scheduled ourselves for April with too many closings and it\\'s only worse now with some subs not wanting to work or suppliers closing or having different procedures. We have 10 projects going right now. 3 close in April and 2 in early May üò© I‚Äôm a commercial construction worker that‚Äôs home now. It‚Äôs a parking garage in the bay, our company has 3 jobs in the Bay Area and mine is the only one shutdown right now because of the county it‚Äôs in. I‚Äôm starting to feel liked we‚Äôre the only ones not working. Boss is having a meeting today to find out when we go back to work after San Francisco extended it‚Äôs shelter in place to another month. Do you not want a job? Do you think we all just get a vacation? I‚Äôm in construction but I‚Äôm still working from home and sometimes the office. The best is when they add gravel to \"help\" so then you just have Rocky mud lmao Been there.  I feel your pain op.  That makes me feel slightly better about my day. Thanks! I‚Äôve only seen mud like that once. Upstate NY. It was a nightmare.  Craft is covered in mud before they pick up a tool. Why would they care about the work they do if that‚Äôs the greeting they get when they arrive? Welcome to Canada!! This is poor project management.  Pure and simple.  There is no need to work a piece of equipment in those ground conditions. It‚Äôs mildly unsafe as well depending on the task assigned to the operator.  Not to mention the cost overrun associated with cleanup after the fact..... Past time to get to rig mats placed? This looks like my site! But it could be any site... yay for mud season!  Dat compaction Update: It rained this morning. FML Why does everyone skip the step of just putting down base first and waterproofing the work area? I can‚Äôt figure out why people are surprised by muddy conditions or complain about lost productivity. Plate your work area!  Oof So the best solution is rig mats, correct?\\n\\nAre there still good solutions that are more cost effective than rig mats? It‚Äôs rut szn boys.  Bring in the big rig to compact it then lay gravel Few tonnes of gravel my friend. Remind the person cutting checks that the holdup and extra fuel use and drivers wages will cost more than the gravel in the long run. They\\'ll have the gravel waiting in the morning. Why wouldn\\'t you clean it up so you have a decent work area? Their concern is legitimate. If anyone thinks Safety or cleanliness regulations, on an active job site, is going to prevent people or their families from getting COVID, you are absolutely kidding yourself. ‚ÄúThe union says the Trump administration\\'s order blocking OSHA from issuing regulations to protect workers from COVID-19‚Äù\\n\\nWhy am I not surprised. I don‚Äôt care if your union or not. 90% of construction you can‚Äôt social distant for. Try installing a window with one person or a 250# door. I‚Äôve been doing carpentry for 20+ years and have done a lot of stuff alone. Theirs some you just need more people for. I also hear about the other side because my wife is a nurse. Trust me you don‚Äôt want covid-19 They\\'re walking off our job at Somerville HS on Friday. I\\'m in local 4, IBEW and laborers are apparently out so we\\'re out as well. I‚Äôm a small remodeling company and there is no way we can be six feet apart working in a bathroom or even some kitchens we do.  Two of my guys left the state when this all started and the other two are too scared to come to work.  So it‚Äôs just me and my husband finishing up three job sites in various stages.  Only one of the houses is actually occupied and I insisted the home owners wear masks while we are there. I wish my state would shut us down, I hate going to the hardware store. Good start we are 200 000 construction worker not working in quebec.. Everyone needs to wear some sort of mask 100% of the time when in public, folks. Curious if we could go back to work with 100% respirator usage. Go figure, a union ordering its members to not work. How innovative Wondering how consistent it is at maintaining the proper spacing and if it can move the double weighted barrels. I‚Äôd definitely buy it for our crews. Less guys on the road the more comfortable I am.  Never can fully trust the traveling public.  Dey took err cone moving jerbs! This is very satisfying to watch  More efficient than ever at making my commute miserable! Reminds me of the time I was moving my 18 wheeler steady through a 1 lane construction quarter and came upon a big ol orange cone RIGHT in the center of the lane, that all the cars in front of me were going around. Unfortunately I can\\'t play zigzag in a semi so it wound up under my bumper for a few miles. Got out to check on it when there was a safe shoulder and it was gone lol. I did pass a cone crew. Most-likely using something like this here. r/SpecializedTools  Was a PM on a post office in Miami, structural guys found a body when digging the footer. It was across from the police station. Not sure what happened... but my crew got the day off Was on a subdivision projects and the edge ran next to a small natural gas facility. The haul road ran right next to it and a 637 clipped a 4\" pipe that showed up on the edge of the road. Lot\\'s of oh shits but thankfully it was a dry stub. Who called DIGSAFE?! Was working on building an access road in a tiny town right off the highway. Found a skeleton under the culvert bridge thing that we were making wider. Got off work for a couple weeks, didn\\'t get paid for them though. Im a construction plumber, we were doing underground piping for a old age apartment addition and we hit this big steel box, me on the mini excavator thinking it was utilities, we made the call for locates. Well anyways we eat lunch and i get back at it, again being careful because of the fear of inaccurate utilitie marking. I then hit a wooden box 20ft away from the steel one. Hop off the mini ex and go in with a shovel to uncover this box. Anyway 3 shovels later, i finally clue in what the boxes are, it was an unmarked barial ground. \\n\\nThe most fucked part was i found out later from the guy who the city sent out to inspect the site that steel coffins were used to bury people with deadly diseases. Pretty wild stuff. Also he told me that while he drilled a hole in the side of the coffin and black liquid came out. What happens if you do find a body? One time we were digging a ditch and hit a root that looked red. It looked just like a cable. I even checked it with my pen tester before we realized what it was! Lol I literally said \\'oh shit\\' after saw the photo at first glance. LOL Lol I‚Äôm glad you can laugh about it. I‚Äôm not superstitious but I will definitely not be buying any of those houses. He‚Äôs got that stacked so high it makes you actually understand why the ladders on top. You guys talking trash but never actually went frame to finish...\\n\\nEven a bathroom remodel in a busy suburb can have your truck stacked like this on dump run day... Looks like load in/load out day. \" hey Jimmy can you grab the jigsaw, should be by the shop vac somewhere\" This guy needs a Mercedes Sprinter. One call does it all I‚Äôm so confused I see pick straps, ladder, pigeon hole shovel,  maybe a vibrating skreed?  Wtf is this guy on his way to do Or he just robbed somebody\\'s trailer. I‚Äôd love to see the yard sale (from a safe distance) if he had to swerve, or make any kind of emergency maneuver. If e swear that this was my nephews truck if it weren‚Äôt for the California plates I‚Äôm sure he does a decent job. Just needs a larger truck. Lol ...except organize The life of a hard working contractor.  Most of us like this will do more work loading and unloading tools in a day then most do all week.  And that\\'s just to get a job started. Jack of all master of none hah Chuck in a truck. Idiot I got lucky at 17 when I got small wood chip lodged into my eye while cutting lumber down. Couldn‚Äôt even open my eye enough to wash it out it burned so much. The next morning my eye was crusted over, I guess it tried to heal itself. Anyway it was blurry in that eye for about a week. Now I have a sweet red scar on my eyeball and I always wear eye pro. The vegetation in the background tells me this is somewhere tropical where the rules don\\'t matter and safety is optional. 30\" hydraulic handsaw is no joke but I don\\'t see anything wrong with this - aside from the lack of hearing, respiratory and eye protection. This was probably taken someplace like florida where the concrete is soft.\\n\\n[https://www.werkmaster.com/mohs-concrete-tester/](https://www.werkmaster.com/mohs-concrete-tester/) My dude is just trynna get the job done.

Anyone in my company caught pissing anywhere other than a goddamn toilet would be promptly shitcanned.  I learned real early on to never open a drywall bucket on a job site unless you brought it yourself. Ha. It\\'s funny bc pee. Yes this is common on our job sites unfortunately. Yes it\\'s mostly the sheetrockers. I laughed my ass off when I saw [this article](https://pagesix.com/2017/10/30/bottles-of-urine-found-in-walls-of-luxury-nj-condo/) on the topic. Happens at luxury places too.    the wide mouth gatorade bottles are the best.  never buy the yellow gatorade tho.\\n\\nUsed to work at high altitudes--no bathrooms, carry in, carry out.\\n\\n\\n\\n As a tradesman for over 15 years, I\\'ll throw anybody under the bus as hard as I can over this. \\n\\nIt\\'s disgusting, are we animals? Apparently some are. It gives all blue collar workers everywhere a bad name. \\n\\nIf any of my guys do this, and I find out, it\\'s immediate two checks and dont let the door hit you on the way out. \\n\\n Or truckers, or farmers,  or Amazon  employees, or miners, or, or, or... piss jugs are everywhere. Never trust the yellow water. It\\'s a minefield out there.  If you are a new guy on a paving crew don‚Äôt drink any bottles on the spreader. It‚Äôs usually a diesel mix for the equipment. I‚Äôve seen 1 orange hat (new guy) take a swig before and throw up. Those and spit bottles from the guys that dip.....fucking gross Whoever did this one appears to have been weirdly well hydrated. I just imagine some poor soul putting in new fixtures, updating the hotel, and drilling into one of those after sitting in the wall for 15+ years; turning brown and fermenting.  Has anybody on here from Canada ever seen this?  I\\'ve never seen this.  I\\'m residential though. That ain\\'t lemonade. One time we had a pill billy of a sparky pee on a box of our plumbing fittings for no apparent reason . people get crazy gross They\\'re all over the scaffolding in a boiler. The project manager for the company I was working for on that outage had a high speed come apart at a safety meeting over it.  Also don\\'t open the 5 gallon buckets that feel light when there is no porta potty on site A couple of months ago, someone pissed in a register vent that was to be under a cabinet. Savages. I would rather see this shit than deal with that. I\\'ve caught a pest control contractor taking a piss in a bottle inside a finished, operating factory. It\\'s not always the drywallers... R/gatekeeping  I can confidently say I‚Äôve worked on numerous large projects and I‚Äôve yet to see a piss bottle. You guys understand why Gatorade bottles have a wider mouth?  Taxi drivers will understand.\\n\\n&#x200B; Yeahhhh haha I drive long distances for work, and absolutely HATE having to stop to take a piss. SOOO I\\'ve started having my wife save our laundry detergent bottles for mobile Porta potties haha - they have a nice wide hole, a sturdy handle, and are large enough to use  about half a dozen times before you gotta toss them in a dumpster lol As a general contractor, no this is not a thing.  This is evidence that you have homeless people on your jobsite at night, or it is rvidence that your subcontractors are hiring homeless people. My red cooler...

Looks like someones been playing too much bridge builder What a fucking complete catastrophe. Sucks for those dudes. Lol the \"FUCK\" scream and distressed beeping of forklifts at the end ‚ÄúPIVOT!‚Äù FYI a load of that many strings of rail is roughly 60tons. \\n\\nIt looks like at least 130lb rail. (130lbs per 3 feet) and they\\'re 80ft long. \\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about fork lifts though. So maybe they could technically do that much weight. The second I saw they needed to drive up and slope, pick up a load and then back down a slope I knew they were fucked with vertical mast machines. When the camera moved and I saw the other forklifts I cracked up. It was so obviously going to happen. I didn\\'t see the derailment coming though, what a fuckup I\\'ve tandem picked shit but that was retarded Lol that\\'s a big ol fuck up As my favorite contemporary hobo would say - FNBS.

Dude probably will drive to work all proud and excited about finally proving himself to the guys and when he gets there he will be treated with his coworkers walking in, glancing at the work he did, saying nothing, and continue walking.

Forks available at all Times... OP: Boss, I need another pair of glasses\\n\\nBoss: That‚Äôs your third pair this week! What happened to the ones I gave you?\\n\\nOP: Well..... Keep your eye on this guy! He\\'s an innovator!  If they don\\'t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy. Keep your stick on the ice Ha thats a new one That\\'s pretty good! \\n\\nI started keeping a box in the backseat with plastic cutlery, learned that lesson once and won\\'t ever again. \\n\\n\\nNext issue is for when I\\'m on LOA, I need to remember to pack at least a couple contaners or bowls. My last out of town job I was eating those salad packages right out of the bag. Dump the dressing and toppings, mix it all in the bag and you\\'ve got your bowl. Doesn\\'t work too wel with anything else though. Haha nice. On two occasions I\\'ve cut chopsticks out of a 2x4.  Get a sparky to give you a small length of 12/2 romex. Strip about 1.5\" of the wires and bend to a fork shape.  Wow not bad. You should be an engineer.  I‚Äôve had to use the top of a yogurt cup or those little applesauce packages. I was really desperate once and used a fairly clean putty knife. I try and keep a few in the truck though. \\n\\nGreat pull OP I have found that Chisels work great , especially for spreading peanut butter but this here my friend is genius.  I will be breaking a pair of safety glasses soon!!  /r/OSHA Um, I\\'m a woman, so I pack my own damn lunch and I never forget cutlery because I have a multi-tool from REI in a pinch. I\\'ve been known to use a wooden shim. Safety glasses cut where the bridge of the nose goes. Instant spoon One time for a team building event we brought a bunch of 3‚Äô subs to the job.. things were huge! Only thing around to cut them with was a sawzaw blade O worked with a Super that was an absolute legend for this. I once watched him eat lasagna with a ballpoint pen. Use the lid apprentice. I\\'ve used my pry bar to scrape the wax ring off of toilets too many times. Automatic gag reflex. But this wooden shim idea intrigues me.... Romex makes a good copper fork I generally make chop stick by splitting the grain on a 2x4 block WhatsAchipFer? Pocket knife; is knife, is fork, is spoon. Trying to suck yogurt out is worst, especially if they don‚Äôt have a foil cap to use as a spoon I\\'ve ripped a 1/4 off a 2x4 and used it to eat leftovers. Flat fork for the win I once borrowed two butter knives to eat my lunch. I got razzed, but it was effective. I used a plastic putty knife for my tapioca last week. I\\'ve used pens as chopsticks to eat a salad. I carry utensils in my bag now lol. I install flooring and use my hook knife alot it seems like. I\\'m hungry! I ate my lunch with a clothes line peg the other day, bad day to bring leftover curry for lunch. Funny you should mention it. I at quinoa salad I made with my face today The good old wonderbar. Truly has gotten me out of shitty moments at work Made a fork out of a chunk of downspout when I was doing gutters. I\\'ve always got my 1\" margin trowel I go to the pack of Ticonderoga pencils as chopsticks. Multiple times. Nothing like using your coworkers fork after they are done eating, just gotta give it a good old fashioned germ ex wash. I‚Äôve used cardboard and plastic bent in a V shape and my knife just all sorts of shit I‚Äôd have to sit down and make a list. Had to cut watermelon with a sawsall once Ate chili with my house key once. It\\'s got a wide handle with Darth Maul pictured. Thick chili was a plus Well, I guess I\\'m adding a pack of plastic cutlery to the random emergency stuff in my truck. I don\\'t personally really eat lunch but I\\'ll be dammed if I\\'m letting someone eat off a prybar. \\n\\nI\\'m the dude that always has spare: water, toilet paper, paper towels, rags, gloves, glasses, paint brush and rollers (still hear my co-workers \"you don\\'t even paint bro wtf\"), roll of plastic drop sheet, roll of paper drop sheet, three kinds of tape, blades for every tool I own, two kinds of wet wipes, three cleaning solutions, five tape measures and utility knives (I misplace tapes and knives like it\\'s a mental disorder). I hate having to run to the store for something small I just use my pencil All the time. Fruit skins and chicken bones make excellentl substitutes The glazer bar is the most useful tool in my belt Yup, I usually end up fabricating a piece of copper into a spoon or fork. Plumber btw.\\n\\nEdit. What kind of special idiot downvotes this? Lol. Legend I prefer the stainless steel veneer tie. I‚Äôve heard time and time again that the construction industry is male-dominated, but this seems excessive. Ah yes, the good old suicide plug. Very common with homeowners wanting to backfeed generators into their houses on the cheap. Lmao... have him hold the end while you plug it in. Had a coworker/ welder do the same on a 208/ 20amp twist lock , he figured it would be fool proof to copy the original end. Sad to say it wasn‚Äôt the last time he done this! Shit\\'s gay yo. My buddy did something similar with a shop vac.  Installed the female end on the cord.  I went to go plug it in and wished I had a cord like yours lol That‚Äôs the ghetto ass adapter for hooking up a generator to a receptacle circuit. Heard about it from a guy. It\\'s only gay if they touch üòÑ Ohh. It is so hard to find a crossover electric cable. Either way, if OSHA sees it you\\'re going to get fined. Safety 3rd! YEE old widow maker Love the Mike Rowe reference! Good luck today and always think safety. That\\'s huge 1600? What you picking at what radius? What‚Äôs the rent on that bad boy? Sweet! Sounds like a fun job to be a part of, big cranes are big fun I\\'m a traffic control supervisor, working in some shady areas in the greter  Sacramento area. My flaggers are threatened by the driving public and pedestrians walking through the job site daily. Yesterday one pedestrian said he was going to get his gun and shoot all of us for holding him at a cross walk. So this is nice to see and I very much do appreciate it. Thanks for the acknowledgement!  I‚Äôm an equipment operator and having a good flagger/spotter is a godsend.  Had a jobsite in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic. When we had trucks enter/exit, we\\'d control pedestrian traffic at the gate by holding plastic chains across the sidewalk on either side. I\\'ve seen people literally duck under the chain and almost get run over. I understand the sentiment, but I don\\'t really understand the picture. Is it supposed to be a memorial or something? I just don\\'t get it. While it is well paying, flagging traffic is crazy dangerous due to all the knucklehead pricks on our roads today.  People in general think this a mindless job but you can sure tell a good flagger from a bad one, which to me means it is anything but mindless. Thanks for keeping us safe! I never really thought of the ever present danger with simply controlling the access to the jobsite. Good post.  As a former intern I enjoyed the power of stopping traffic for safety reasons  Scary stuff for real.  \\nI flagged a bit back in the day and as boring as it was you always had to be on your toes. \\nHad a little old lady screech to a halt about 10 feet from an open sewer trench roughly 12\\' deep.  \\nTook her that long to realize the gas pedal wasn\\'t the brake!  \\nWe\\'ve had several accidents/deaths here in Oregon this summer and it\\'s really scary to read about.  \\nStay safe out there!! I have been around that loop. Is that circle center in Indy? Thats fuckin unsafe I mean I don\\'t essentially care about work safety but this is a bit too much. Appreciate your work though. Always chew gum when in a crawlspace. That way you can reinforce those weak joints on the way to your destination! Obviously. Look at the all the support nails ! Those are shear proof fasteners.  You\\'ll be fine. You may want to put an extra spike in that one. Looks a little sketchy to me.... So long as you are crawling and not climbing... That piece of wood looks 2 mm thick Trailer? Well, apparently safe enough to post on reddit... Needs another staple, then you\\'ll be safe. That passes code The space appears to be well lit, so it must be OSHA approved Totally SHINER This picture gives you no perspective of what the hell is going on, so my answer is \"I don\\'t know.\" Research confined space safety. What happens if you have  a heart attack there?  Break a leg. How do your coworkers get you out? \\n\\nWhere ever you work , you need to think about what could happen , and how do you get to safety. My wife is trying to get me to stop working right now.  I\\'m in western MA. But all my subcontractors are showing up, I\\'m showing up, the client wants us to show up. We are just dirty construction workers.... No one cares if we get sick and die....get back to work Can anybody‚Äôs workforce‚Äôs afford to sit on their asses for 2 weeks is a better question.\\n\\nI know a lot of our guys live paycheck to paycheck. I am a small business, I can cover this up to a certain point but after that it is going to have to be back to work.\\n\\nI hope they come up with some sort of subsidy for people who can‚Äôt get paid  during this period Going hard in SF. Working 6-12‚Äôs. Can‚Äôt build elevators from home haha. No union meetings and I think they cancelled our apprenticeship classes for a while. \\n\\nWouldn‚Äôt be surprised if things start slowing down though. I work for one of the big 5 elevator companies so  could see them being more careful than the smaller shops. In the end I suppose it‚Äôs up to the GC.\\n\\nStay safe and wash your hands brothers and sisters. In Seattle, we are still going.\\n\\nTraffic is great. Lol if we stop doing our trade then the builder will just bring in someone else. Our client asked for any potential materials that could be delayed and mitigation efforts if we have to shut down for two weeks. My project is nearly done so luckily I have no concerns about materials not showing up but there is plenty of labor to do through August. Being that this is a school project...kind of forced to get it done in time for the start of the school year. I don‚Äôt know if this has been mentioned anywhere, but are our employers required to pay us if the country as a whole goes into a quarantine?\\n\\nSlightly worried about that. We do interior finish out work in high rises, we\\'re discussing strategies with building management if there\\'s a significant risk inside the building. I work in the AV industry; we have had lots of clients cancel appointments. I‚Äôve only worked two days this week and one day last week. New baby comes this weekend and I‚Äôm screwed financially atm Right now i\\'m working a project in the international terminal of a major airport and no one as of yet has even hinted at shutting the project down.\\n\\nIn fact they are on our ass daily about how long it\\'s taking... Sorry dude, you can only go so fast when you work hours for welding and making noise are from 10pm to 430am. I\\'m an estimator and have underlying health issues and was just told today to work from home through March. These are weird times. We had our monthly safety meeting this morning but also talked about CV. My job depends on the metal market, so far the stock market is holding okay on metal prices. Obviously, we‚Äôre not going to be shipping anything internationally and there‚Äôs not a huge market for it nationally right now. I rarely come in contact with people since I‚Äôm an equipment operator. They said we‚Äôll continue to work and see what happens but anyways I could care less about myself since I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs and relatively healthy. What I‚Äôm worried about though, are my parents who are in their mid 60‚Äôs which they‚Äôre also healthy but dad works in a major hospital and mom works with children and my girlfriend and her family live overseas very close to Asia. Here‚Äôs to hoping everything will pass very soon. Still out here in mi doing siding. On lake st Clair today I\\'m in the process of billing everything we have open right now in the event of inevitable shut downs. It\\'s extremely concerning in the construction industry, especially when you consider the fact that the median age of a construction worker is older than many other industries. I run a water jet for a glass fabrication factory that mainly provides things like shower doors and enclosures for new construction. I received my orders via email. I usually get about 20 to 40 a day. In the last two days I\\'ve had one and that was yesterday morning. Absolutely nothing today. Still going strong in NC. Was just having this conversation and I‚Äôm honestly not sure what is going to happen. I can do probably 60% of my job from home the rest being field supervision. On a very high profile job where time and public eye are the biggest factors, I can‚Äôt imagine anyone would just go ghost on the job. There could be a specific outbreak throughout the entire construction industry and our bosses would still threaten to fire us if we took a day off because ‚Äúshit man I come in when IM sick, so idk what your problem is man if u don‚Äôt want to be here go work at Wendy‚Äôs‚Äù. I work for New Englands largest HVAC and plumbing wholesaler and as of this morning we have cancelled all customer/ employee trainings as well as counter day gatherings I‚Äôm a superintendent for a large scale renovation of a pathology lab in a major state university hospital that just announced their first cases of COVID-19. Things have been pretty crazy the last few days, really ramping up. However, we are not shutting down yet, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs on the table for next week. There‚Äôs word they might be utilizing the exhaust fans we were in the process of demo‚Äôing to help set up temporary isolation containment units for the expected influx of patients. So that‚Äôs interesting. I\\'m in PA but I already work from home, I\\'m just waiting for the email that says to stay home from all job sites, we are allowed to take up to 10 days off if we live in an area that is a quarantine area, but I do not We have two projects in senior care facilities all work has been suspended. One we only had a few rooms left and punchlist to complete now who knows how long until we will be able to finish I run a small home remodeling business and all my interior jobs are being pushed back. Luckily I have a few exterior jobs in the meantime.\\n\\nI will also be ordering all my materials for delivery as soon as I can. We‚Äôre building a Commons building for the university of Denver. The university is going to online classes for a while, but we have no plans of shutting down. We\\'ve had PM\\'s screening workers for COVID-19 before they enter sites. They were joking about it only a couple days ago, but now they\\'ve really changed their tune.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: and by screen, I mean ask if they\\'ve traveled to any of the high risk areas, or if they are showing symptoms. There are no tests. Working in NE on a hospital, I\\'ve been home for a few days now. The site is still going strong, but I showed up with a little cough and they told me to take the rest of the week off. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if we get shut down entirely though in the next week. As of right now no way.  Doing a water bureau job and it‚Äôs kind of a unspoken thing lingering but no one wants stop working.  I mean I‚Äôm fine with it if they deferred all my bills but until then we‚Äôll be on site everyday.  Kind of have to I do so love this industry- usually it‚Äôs the brickies that are fucking whiners - this now seems to have spread.\\n\\nEvery company and owner I have worked for in NE (healthcare & higher ed) have valued and thanked the trades for doing what they do.  So perhaps you need to look for a new line of work in this industry.\\n\\nYour issue is not with the client or owner - it‚Äôs with your chicken shit leadership at your own company - they are grinding you all to a knub and blaming the owner.  \\n\\nOwners will do what they are allowed to do - if they want a 10 month job done in 8 months and your leadership signs a contract to that effect who‚Äôs responsible?  They will take jobs that are based in fantasyland by some owner who needs to be educated or some architect who doesn‚Äôt pay attention the to world around them\\n\\nThe GC/CM brings a skill set to the process and that needs to be sought out, respected and valued by all involved.  But instead companies continue to shoot themselves in the foot and screw clients over as far as meeting the clients expectations.\\n\\nThis industry screws itself over and then cry‚Äôs poor as the owners of the company‚Äôs drive their luxury cars to their luxury homes.  It‚Äôs the only industry I know that owners have to hire a 3rd party firm (OPM‚Äôs) in order to deal with the bullshit the GC/CM or the A&E firm is tossing against the wall.  Not even used car salesman are treated with that kind of disdain.  And it‚Äôs all the fault of the construction industry.\\n\\nYour company - if it had balls would say ‚Äúwe value our employees safety and we are shutting down the job until such time as this force majeure (that should be in your contract with the owner) passes.‚Äù  But they don‚Äôt - why is that? Cash flow? \\n\\nYou betcha - luxury cars and houses don‚Äôt pay for themselves- your sore back pays for it. \\n\\nAs my favorite Jamaican labor used to say ‚Äúain‚Äôt nothing to but to do it.‚Äù  So get back to work! I get this question from guys all the time right now. They say it‚Äôs not safe and we shouldn‚Äôt be working. Then I ask would you be willing to stay home without pay? Then we work. \\n\\nAin‚Äôt no way for a company to cover everyone‚Äôs payroll and have everyone shut down not working. What state are you in? My job are still up and running but with a lot of health precautions. My city is still relatively unaffected with only 2 reported cases with a population of 250,000 Thankfully my project is in the punch out stage, so I don\\'t have to interact with many people. Just a handful of guys I point to things at for them to fix. Nope I‚Äôm working through with my company In the uk none in the construction industry are staying at home and if theres one industry that should its ours I‚Äôm still working, I don‚Äôt plan on stopping because I need the money, so hopefully sites don‚Äôt get shut down California here, working on the freeway. Headquarters in San Francisco. Caltrans don‚Äôt care about CV, they want us to keep working..... I‚Äôm currently on a hotel project. The buildings occupancy has really died down since the start of all this. A lot of big conferences/shows here have been canceled and rooms are empty. The GC announced in the meeting if it keeps going the way things are there is a high probability that the project gets shut down. I know our big yearly union meetings canceled but the job sites are still active My job hasn‚Äôt stopped yet but I work for myself. If there comes a time when people aren‚Äôt leaving their homes at all then I will be forced to stay home too. Waiting for the job site to open rn We have a job at a hospital here in N.C. and it has been postponed until further notice. Working in central London, public transport is noticeable quiet. Its FANTASTIC!!! Rumors are someone was showing symptoms at Mile Long Bridge in Willow Springs near Chicago. That project may be delayed. I work for a large GC on a site with 700+ people...talks about shutdowns have been ongoing, we have to have an official shutdown plan prepared by the end of day tomorrow.  We have hired second shift cleaners to sanitize all handrails/doorknobs etc.  Everything is escalating very quickly.  All it would take is 1 person presumed positive to shut the whole thing down.  Thats what we are preparing for, and what I personally am expecting. I‚Äôve got no updates on my projects shutting down, but I work in the office and we received an email today saying we‚Äôre testing out working from home tomorrow and Monday. If I had to bet we‚Äôre going to start shutting down job sites in the next month or so Desk job guy here. I still have to come into work but I‚Äôm not allowed site visits at this time Lol That‚Äôs what we are waiting for now. We‚Äôve already had 2 shit weeks with rain and jobs pushing, and if one of the big GC‚Äôs we work for decides to shut down for 2 weeks, we‚Äôll have almost 0 revenue in March. Interesting times. Boss man keeps paying me and I‚Äôll show up. I work in NYC, I\\'m more worried about mass transit shutting down than my site lol I am afraid this will happen to me in a couple of weeks , the company I work for will only last like a month at most without production We are GCs for the Houston based apartment industry. It\\'s a bit slow but there is work to be done. Earlier this week we painted 30 + units . For different buildings obviously We have a job site standdown this Friday to \\'talk about\\' the virus, symptoms and how to treat them. Yah this sounds like a great idea, lets stuff 150 tradesmen on a single floor after coffee break. FFS I‚Äôm from Croatia. Most of materials are coming from Italy, which is blocked now, so we are starting to slow down. \\nI have team of 6 workers plus me, and we live in an apartment literally 100 meters from construction site. We will keep working till we have materials.\\nI know everybody thinks about corona now, but if it continues for a few more weeks it will trigfer recession and then we are in shithole, we will beg for work then, and stupid investors will just hold on to money. Some of our work in Washington at a major employer is shut down I\\'m a pipefitter in UT and I\\'m all outta work.. just enough savings to last maybe a month Not because of the Coronavirus, but I just got diagnosed with the flu this morning. Sent home for a mandatory four day period. I pleaded with my boss to let me stay and work but he refused to let me. It\\'s apparently a new policy that started because of the Coronavirus. Just cut your leg off Use mineral oil, rub it in to the tar and use a rag to wipe with off as you go. You don‚Äôt dude it‚Äôs just apart of you now Diesel fuel will also work Feathers usually work. What the fuck are you wearing on your feet First stages of Grayscale? Why were you not wearing high boots and pants? Gasoline is your best friend at this point. It‚Äôll work quick I promise. Oof bad luck Chuck Dear God mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, not sure if goo gone is safe for skin contact but thats what i use to get the tar off my vehicles WD-40 believe it or not. GoJo and Dawn. Use some feathers to wipe it off. gas or diesel work really well +1 for gasoline If you don‚Äôt mind, rub it with layer thinner, but rinse off with water asap so it doesn‚Äôt mess up your skin A roofer once told me they use mayonnaise when they get hot tar on their skin. Wd-40, gasoline, or paint thinner Legs are now refurbished and clean. Who woulda thought, sunflower oil. Thanks guys. Too broke to give you all gold but keep it in your hearts you helped a kid get clean before a huge dinner party tomorrow. Thanks! My husband says kerosene. Lestoil is some orange oil stuff that works pretty good for most tar I‚Äôve used Acetone to remove it from clothes and skin without issue before. I‚Äôve had luck with butter taking off acoustic seal, so maybe that will work you wont Where pants next time You don\\'t. Thumbnail made it look like a sick tattoo. Just leave it on haha Looks like you have some good alternatives here so I\\'ll add this in retrospect:\\n\\n\\nBlood.  Sweat.  And tears. Try Mineral Spirits and a tooth brush WD-40 will get it off Naptha? Acetone Carb cleaner. I got two lots of news for ya, good and bad.\\nThe good news is, one leg is no longer going to be tar covered OR hairy.\\nThe bad news is, you gotta slather foundation tar on that other leg. Gasoline works great .  just keep rubbing in in and wiping it off . Don‚Äôt smoke while you do this Tell everyone it\\'s just a small spider bite or something else. Have fun with it that\\'s my advice haha Start by throwing away your tom‚Äôs WHAT ARE THOSE  !!!!!!!!!!!! Super clean, diesel, goo gone, acetone. All the stuff you don‚Äôt want on your skin Buy contractors solvent/orange cleaner.\\nI\\'m a roofer :P Anything oil based Are you a hobbit? Fast orange and mineral spirits. Alternate with scalding hot water in between. How‚Äôs about canola oil? In general engine degreaser will get most water proof products. That shit has saved me a lot of scrubing Wax on... Wax off.  Vegetable oil. Gasoline will work best. Actually, paint thinner will work best, but its not very good for you.\\n\\nWelcome to waterproofing! Time The same way you got it on there, but reversed. Did u try WD-40 ? \\nAlso I pray to allah to have mercy on you Bro you need to get that shoe off your foot & buy a pair of nikes or something Paint thinner is pretty effective, but it‚Äôll irritate the crap out of your skin. You‚Äôll still have to scrub so just expect to have a raw leg Diesel fuel and burn ya leg off works on my rake Amputation. Gasoline works magic on tar but be careful no sparks or open flames while doing it otherwise you\\'ll turn into sonic in a flash lol Brake cleaner Just blowtorch the tar off! It\\'ll melt quickly, along with your ability to use your leg and your sanity. I used to be a hot tar roofer. Yeah, I remember that.. day. \\n\\nMitch Hedberg WD-40 would probably work WD-40 F Petrol Baby oil is great for scrubbing it off without also scratching up your leg. Coconut oil and soap! Gasoline White spirit will break down any bitumen based product Xylene Gasoliiiiinna! you dont Fire Burn it?\\n\\nEdit: were you trying to paint your leg? Feathers work nicely. Gasoline Gasoline is the way to go Bleach. here\\'s what you do:\\n\\nvote for Medicare For All,\\n\\nand you won\\'t have to turn to Reddit for medical advice.\\n\\nF\\\\*\\\\*k Trump I sit in my tower crane far away from everyone Because  nobody gives a s*** about dirty construction workers We\\'re shut Down in Washington state, most of us 1-3 man crews building houses wish they were working...\\n\\nEspecially small business owners I\\'m thankful to not only be working, but even getting overtime to go with it. That being said, the project were working on is an expansion/remodel on a hospital so I do feel a slight bit essential. I found an old half squashed N95 mask in my trunk I‚Äôve been wearing for a week now As someone who has never worked construction, I would not know that construction workers are still working if I didn\\'t get that information from you folks. I admit that I just joined this sub to see my childhood toys come to life, but you are real people being purposefully erased from the public eye and that\\'s fucked up. Most essential workers are to keep individuals alive.  Construction workers are to keep the economy alive. \\n\\nShutting down construction also hurts the entire supply chain.  Logging, mines, manufacturers, refractories, developers, contractors, GCs, owners, suppliers, etc.  These aren‚Äôt minimum wage industries, good paying jobs in high dollar industries that pay a lot in taxes. I spray sunblock when working in the sun In NY the Governor shut down non-essential construction. So hospitals and infrastructure projects are still going. You just have to \"try\" and maintain social distancing. Our job, affordable housing in SF is doing a good job constantly sanitizing all floors and stairwells throughout the day (they hired additional labor just for this), stairwells are whither up or down travel, two to the man lift. \\n\\nAs a company we are sanitizing tools, working separate and social distancing at break. I‚Äôm an elevator constructor so we‚Äôre pretty separated from the rest of the other trades for the most part. Our site JUST released a plan. Washing stations on floors, hand sanitizers at elevators, distancing. Real nice to do it now In Michigan it\\'s not, we\\'ve been out of work for a couple weeks now.  I got on unemployment, but just recently picked up a temp job instead to keep me busy, but I\\'m a strange duck and I\\'m in a fairly safe area--low population very few cases etc. I agree wholeheartedly, what we are building is not essential, we are being exposed to a \"known hazard\" unnecessarily and unlike some of the bigger jobs there is nothing being done to mitigate that hazard on my job. I have suggested that we set up some wash basins where a guy could properly wash his hands, I have suggested that we pour some bleach in our Hudson sprayers and disinfect the site and commonly used tools and lifts and I have suggested that we start running split shifts to help guys socially distance but it only led to me getting an earful from the superintendent. \\n\\nThis is a crock, safety is a joke. Wow they give you masks on your site? Must be nice.... Michigan construction got shutdown unless the job deemed essential Because you guys don\\'t make Unicorn Lattes for their writers. I work commercial construction in Canada-mostly grocery stores so I get we are somewhat essential. We are the GC so there‚Äôs been some challenges. But we got pumped water hand wash stations, upped porta potty cleaning, wipe down our tools, disinfect common areas (doors, handrails, etc), instructed our trades to do so as well, ensure social distancing, limiting site to 50 workers, have 2x weekly Covid briefings. \\nI am struggling to find cleaning products and PPE that is necessary for my guys to do their jobs. I have been able to provide nitrile gloves, hand sani, and 1/2 mask respirators. \\nI will say that the cooperation and camaraderie that we have built up on our site has helped a lot though! With the fact that all we can do is work and go home and stay home, it‚Äôs nice to have a great team. I said that a second Hawai‚Äôi home for a non-resident wasn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and quarantined myself. Construction trade associations and lobbyists have a lot of pull right now in many states and they want to keep the workforce in place. It took us a decade to catch up to pre 2009 recession workforce numbers and they refuse to let us our workforce dwindle again if they can prevent it. Still building condos in southern California.  We apparently have a housing crisis here and have been told that\\'s the reason. Not sure we are building affordable housing though üòÇ We are essential as we are keeping the economy going by fixing a housing shortage. That is what I found out why I can keep my business going right now. I think that might change as soon as this week. We have people dropping out of their contract. A larger electricial company told me three of their 20 neighborhoods they are wiring have shut down. So prepare yourselves if you living in a high effective area like I do. They are saying end of June before they would consider even opening our state. Go to Home Depot and see all the people Black Friday shopping and you would think everything is fine. Not sure why so many people can\\'t grasp the severity of the situation, just stay home and we can get through this a lot quicker. In California we‚Äôre still building everything. I wonder if they just don‚Äôt want more people unemployed. Imagine how much bigger of a shit the economy would be taking if another 7.5mil people weren‚Äôt working. It doesn‚Äôt make it right, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve been thinking. At least you‚Äôre getting masks. We get nothing unless we provide it ourselves. Our GC brought in 1 ‚Äúhand washing station‚Äù for 60 guys funny thing is, it‚Äôs not hooked up to anything because there‚Äôs no water to the project yet! We razed hell here in Ontario messaging our premier and unions demanding shut down of non-essential sites. Got the message through and most workers last day was the 3rd. Only sites open now are hospitals and the likes. /r/ABoringDystopia Here in NYC I\\'m home collecting $1100 a week unemployment because 90% of construction has been deemed non essential I can think of multiple hazards on any given job site that are far more likely to kill you than COVID-19. And we should be grateful to still be working. A lot of people I‚Äôve heard complaining are people who just want time off work, I have a coworker who even admitted this. However, time off doesn‚Äôt pay the bills in construction.\\n\\nYou don‚Äôt hear talks about us because we are the people everyone hates, but everyone needs. We make noise, inconvenience people, shut down roads, but when shit goes wrong, or shit needs built, there we are. Also ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always entail huge projects with 100+ workers. It encompasses projects of all types, and emergency repairs of all types (such as infrastructure, plumbing, electric, and so on). Not in US, we have been locked down for 4 weeks and looking forward to getting back out there. But listening to posts like this make me thankful for our governments swift action. (Never thought I would say that) Thankful to be working civil in Colorado. Spend more time in the home office, enough time on site with a mask. Keep 10 feet, don\\'t share equipment - spray it with virucide several times a day.\\n\\nWe\\'re getting more done due to less traffic. Luckily I only have one other person at home, and I think we\\'ve both already recovered from COVID. We are fixing all the people\\'s broken sinks toilets water heaters garage door openers....everything that can break in your house...during quarentine...we fix it    stop buying fucking diy projects shot at home Depot s we can do our own job and stay home    building new homes isn\\'t essential...parts of our jobs are..most arnt....we can\\'t pay fast food workers enough to live yet all of sudden people who prepare shitty fast food and scan barcodes at grocery stores are saints and deserve 90k a year. üôè The people that are working..HAVE to work.  It isn\\'t like any essential business had to shut down.. they got to stay open..you can\\'t say no to your job or thell fire you...I\\'m sure almost everyone wants o be at home ..theyres random businesses that have parts that matter and parts that don\\'t.. sure as fuck don\\'t need icecream and dildos. The only thing standing between me and certain coronavirus is a thin piece of dry-fit cloth these days. I work residential. The site supervisors are supposed to be scheduling properly to keep trades apart, but some trades don\\'t listen. I show up early, and lock all the doors in the house so I\\'m alone. If someone manages to get in, I yell at them until they leave, then rat them out to the super. This week I got two people kicked off the site for the day. Still remodeling bathrooms and kitchens in Idaho (one of the last 4 states to get a confirmed case and among the first 17 to shut down, plus it‚Äôs somewhat rural so it hasn‚Äôt hit us as hard). My boss is taking it seriously after brushing it off at first, my coworker not so much (insists on not wearing a mask and getting in my bubble to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me when I don‚Äôt need help). I wear a mask when I have to get close to people (especially him), otherwise I just try to keep a distance and not schedule our subs on the same day. At least my boss realizes we need to step it up and advertise our compliance with CDC guidelines to get new jobs. Don\\'t be a bitch. Business as usual for the construction boys! \\n\\nI\\'m so glad to have a job at the moment! WHY people work in office cubicles is beyond me. They will never know 25* watching the sunrise with the safety beep of the lull lifting up materials. Sunset heart hands? Looking at this photo makes me recall.. the smell of coffee and cigarettes.  Red in the morning, sailors take warning. Take care up there.  Do you go through a full safety check each day before going up? Is that time on the clock ? 600 Feet up and you don\\'t even have proper toe board on that railing, wtf Wow what a view! Work safely my friend  How‚Äôs the climb every morning ? You like the Doka system? SCREW THAT!! lol\\n Whats up with the strange whaler placement on the forms? Trip hazards everywhere. PTE stressing machine, commercial forming, Gerdau, which job is this? You in south Florida right?  Oil rig? Nope. What kind of work do you do specifically? I‚Äôd like to get into something like that but don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd start. Apartments?\\nThey seem small but curious. Have a good pour Stay safe guys! Good to see somebody working hard in the mud. I can see you from my house! Is this the job over on Cobb parkway ? 41m Schwin? Good work guys\\n\\nDoes anyone need an architect ?? Tell me more about the green crane thing you got going. Holding the camera right is key in moving up the ladder.  At least you\\'re sitting in a warm truck rather than standing in the cold. Cup of coffee and a good podcast and you\\'re set.  chuck in some earplugs so you don\\'t have to listen to that shit for the next two hours. Look on the bright side, after you finish you will be the best turn bucket disassembler this side of the Mississippi. Unfortunately, you will never be able to use this skill again. Ah, an F-150 dash with a 1/4\" of dust on it, I know this work truck feel all too well. You‚Äôre going to be an apprentice forever if you keep doing your work upside down.  Using power tools to work safer and faster while also being ‚Äòlazy‚Äô.  (Lazy can be good).  Stellar job! Good podcasting time why are you completely disassmbling 245 turnbuckles? Plan your work. Work your plan. Nice Whatcha doing??  This is the meaning of work smarter not harder You steal my truck, fucker? Ford F-150? Easy money  Get a second drill, create a second hook,  set it to spin in the opposite direction to the first drill, hook it into the other end and spin both at once.\\n\\nWould that work and effectivly double your speed?  Do it by hand. Paid by the hour. Not by the turn buckle.\\n\\nMaybe y‚Äôall need to see the /s Hahaha, this guy thinks he can get deck boards! Good luck Looks solid, thanks for sharing! Awesome thank you I‚Äôm curious about your process. Are you giving your customer only the estimate letter and invoice? Are you giving them the labor/materials log with the invoice? Thanks This is great, I\\'ll be using this! Thanks! I don\\'t personally have use for it, but I can appreciate how much work has gone into this. Thank you for sharing your hard work! Good shit there. I use Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms a ton. Invoices, quotes, and marketing material for my drone side-gig, and I use Forms for the safety program at work (site inspection checklists, employee evaluations and write ups, tool box talk guides and checklists, etc.) Having all of that easily accessible to everyone via phone browsers is insanely convenient. Nice work! Thank you for the great post! Stop by /r/estimators sometime. Thanks legend. This is great, really great. Needed a Google sheet to do just this instead of rehashing my own half made effort. I\\'m on a govt site right now and they\\'ve locked the door to the main facility with just a skeleton crew in operation for the next 2 weeks, they\\'re literally bringing in supplies and leaving them in an elevator for the crew to pick up separately. The city has shut down all of their offices and have their employees working from home. Meanwhile we\\'re onsite, staying in hotels, having to eat fast food from the drive through because all the super markets are sold out of almost everything and they send all of us letters saying we are essential and if we choose to leave the project it is voluntarily, but we\\'re still on the hook to being completed on schedule. Like WTF? Where is the logic in that? I spoke with my boss today and expressed my concerns, and he said if we feel it\\'s getting too unsafe we should take off, so I think this will be our last week here for the foreseeable future. It\\'s just infuriating that the Gov\\'t will turn a blind eye towards contractors doing their work for them in this situation. Useless 3 minute \"stretch and flex\" every morning? Check.  Harness up any time I am over 4 feet on a ladder? Check. Kevlar god damned sleeves any time I am working above ceiling grid? Check. Stay home during global pandemic? Get fucked, buddy. Sucks to be a construction worker right now.  I\\'m fairly lucky that I personally do small installations where I\\'m usually with just 1 or 2 other guys and we don\\'t need much contact from anyone else.  \\n\\n\\nA lot of construction workers live paycheck to paycheck, and smaller construction companies are also essentially paycheck to paycheck, they can\\'t afford to shut down for even just a week or 2.  \\n\\n\\nHopefully whatever the government passes eases the burden on this industry, but right now construction sites are ripe for spreading the virus. Take a lay off or furlough. That‚Äôs what our company and union are offering if you don‚Äôt want to work. My job site is crazy clean and following guidelines. I feel ya though man. 10% of my jobsite has tested positive for coronavirus this week. Got me a doctor\\'s note that very politely says ARE YOU FUCKING NUTS and I\\'m staying home\\n\\nI know the company\\'s gotta keep the lights on, but I\\'m not cool with a 20% chance of being hospitalized for $35/hour Yeah man. I‚Äôve been all over twitter making a stink. I‚Äôve already been interviewed by three journalists. New York is scary as shit right now and i‚Äôm building luxury condos that billionaires will rent to millionaires. It‚Äôs amazing how the GCs here seem to be doing nothing and my foreman acts like your some pussy because all of a sudden your production drops because you are not ok with not washing your hands after going the bathroom now. \\n\\nFucking stay safe. All of yous. As a equipment operator I WILL RUN YOUR ASS OVER IF YOU GET WITHIN 10 FEET OF ME. This is crazy, people on here faulting OP for choosing their health and life over money/a job. You know this thing is bad when the Chinese decided to shut down their country and hurt their economy temporarily. Their gov doesn\\'t normally care that a few hundred or thousand die. Not sure if this will help, but I wrote this because I have some similar thoughts:\\n\\n \\n\\nMost employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around... \\n\\nSince a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum: \\n\\n1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment)\\n2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces \\n3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.)\\n4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other.\\n5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift.\\n6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)\\n\\nI assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.\\n\\nThe first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.  \\n\\nTo conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.  \\n\\nThis is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. I work for a GC and I‚Äôm low enough I‚Äôm not making any calls about shutdowns but I hear the conversations with the owners. It bothers me so much that the only thing that gets discussed is how long will delays be and how much will it cost. I have not once heard a single owner or my own company discuss whether or not it‚Äôs safe for the guys in the field to keep the sites open. I can‚Äôt believe as much as every acts like safety comes first that it‚Äôs not a bigger part of the conversation. \\n\\nConstruction is essential is a fucking joke. Essential for what? The economy. You can always ask for a lay-off. Same thing in Ohio for me currently. Our state shelter in place order lists certain types of construction as essential but it\\'s extremely vague. It\\'s complete bull shit because there\\'s a lot left open to interpretation that companies seem to be using as a loop hole to leave all sites running like normal. I wish higher up execs would have the balls to tell clients to shut down truly non-essential sites. For example, I\\'m building a new cafe in an existing office building, real essential..... I‚Äôm kinda curious to know what you mean by toxic masculinity. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from just hang in there and be safe Im working in Chicago ,contractor I work for cut down crews by the bunch and completely shut down some jobs . Only 1 allowed in the elevator at a time drags getting up and down My jobs site in the California Bay Area is shutdown right now. \\nWe got sent home the moment they ordered shelter in place. It‚Äôs a union job building a parking garage so maybe it‚Äôs not essential work, I‚Äôm not sure when we‚Äôre going back. I personally can‚Äôt see us staying shutdown too long because time is money. Today California officially titled construction essentials work too so that might change things. I do commercial stuff. Like maybe one part of one of my projects gets to stay open right now. Got a call from a painter earlier... I dont think hes essential. Did you seriously bring up toxic masculinity? I don\\'t think construction is the right industry for you... Just tell your boss your going into voluntary isolation.  \\n\\nThe people at fucking whataburger are still working, the people at circle K are still working,  the people at Amazon are still working ‚Äî you‚Äôll be fine.  \\n\\nTalk to my bartender about this because she‚Äôd probably suck a cock for $200 at this point We are building an abortion clinic right is that essential lol glad guys are walking off the job Shut up pussy It is essential. You should be happy you still have a job and can work. [deleted] You don‚Äôt like it or scared go home there‚Äôs a bunch of ppl currently without work who are hoping daddy government is going to give them money to get thru the next couple months.  Be grateful you have work because there‚Äôs probably a million or more people who would love a chance to earn money right about now. I 4 one am very happy that Florida hasn\\'t shut down, I like most construction workers I know spend it as fast as I make it. Idiot. You Americans seem very scared of this virus, perhaps it\\'s your culture, you guys seem to love the idea of a doomsday. \\n\\nMight be your lack of universal healthcare, with that said many people are scared in Sweden too. [removed] I lost my best friend to suicide 10 years ago. He was in the construction industry. Here is some more information because the more we talk about it, the more we can prevent it. And yes. It really sucks to walk up to a guy on the crew and ask if he\\'s in a dark place. But hell, we\\'re building nations. We do tough shit every day. We can help prevent the next death. \\n\\nRESOURCES\\n\\nWarning signs:\\nhttps://afsp.org/about-suicide/risk-factors-and-warning-signs/\\n\\nFor workplace leaders:\\nhttp://www.constructionworkingminds.org/\\n\\nGeneral information and more resources:\\nhttps://preventconstructionsuicide.com/\\n\\nOSHA\\'s page:\\nhttps://www.osha.gov/preventingsuicides/ Honest question if we could reduce insurance cost would the employers hire more employees and reduce OT? I love this industry but I also love my friends and family and would like to see them more  but you cant do that working 70+ a week\\n\\nEdit*\\nClarification that I‚Äôm implying better work-life balance could help reduce suicides The amount of men I see living paycheck to paycheck while making $55/hr would make most people shit their pants. Thanks tomorrow mornings safety talk is now changed to mental health check. My crew and I are a tight knit group and I know including my self 4 of us all have a close family member that died by suicide.   These are some strong stats.    Stay safe out there guys and gals both physically and mentally. And yet Reddit has this obsession with suggesting the trades over college.\\n\\nI knew a guy with COPD who was still doing residential carpentry in his 60s. He offed himself with a shotgun a few years ago.\\n\\nThis industry breaks as many people as it makes. Be smart out there, guys. Well I was kinda excited for work tomorrow. Not so much now The work-to-life ratio definitely has a heavy hand in failing mental stability. My husband and I never see each other, and we\\'re not truly \\'travelling\\' yet. On the one hand, we\\'re damn near back to the honeymoon phase of our marriage because we\\'re apart so often and are genuinely excited to be together again. On the other hand, even though we work in the same state and live together, it gets painfully lonely because we work on opposite ends of the state and no one is ever home to keep up the house or make hot meals at that. We live off of sliced deli meats in coolers.\\n\\nI always try to ask questions about wives and kids while I\\'m working with travelling guys. Ask to see pictures, etc. Bring up happy reminders of home, cause I\\'ve definitely met a few who had that soulless look in their eyes. Going home for a week every 3 months has gotta be soul-crushing. Shit, going home every night but having a 2-hour commute each way is soul-crushing.\\n\\nI love working in construction. The work is satisfying and one day I\\'ll make decent money, lol, but the time you have to spend away from home and loved ones is where the whole thing falls apart. You know what the biggest cause of deaths in construction is? \\n\\nSuicides\\n\\nConstruction suicide rate is 4x the national average and is the leading cause of construction fatalities. Construction is #1 in suicides per year and #2 in suicide rate per year. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTalk to your guys. Get a jobsite counselor if you are on a large job. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n [https://www.cfma.org/suicideprevention](https://www.cfma.org/suicideprevention) Remember to tell your boss NO if something, like say putting a ladder up next to a open pit, doesn\\'t seem safe to you. \\n\\nYour life is not worth his production schedule and unless he likes phone calls from OSHA inspectors I\\'m sure he\\'d be glad to find another way.  I bet that guy is notorious for dropping drills. Typical. That is not how I thought that was going to go tits up. This is so perfectly unfortunate.  The way that board threads it\\'s way into the ladder at the end is amazing. 100% dipshittery. All around. He ded Next week‚Äôs safety topic with video. Thanks! That cordless was going to survive until he threw it Where the arrest fall bags at? i‚Äôm takin ya with me bitch Even if your a skywalking-ninja-prince of Persia?? Please god tie the fuck off! It‚Äôs there for the .1% chance you think will never happen. We work in a field that it nothing but dangerous and eventually something is going to go wrong... protect yourself also make sure you are using the right equipment PROPERLY My Forman (my dad) fell off the other day. Tied off harness clipped in. He was undoing the tarps and when he stepped he stepped on the tarp, slid like a pendulum to the edge of the roof and the anchor comes off and FLIES IN THE AIR A GOOD 15 ft. Hits the side of the wall and hits the ground hard (only like a 10 ft fall but enough to hurt) walks it off and gets back to work. Literally the scariest moment on the roof to date. Yes the anchor was on a stud the roof was so rotted that the screws just flew out of the roof. I\\'m waiting for the ring video since it happened right infront of the front door. As some that has had fall pro save my ass.....WEAR IT,  stay tied off, and don\\'t cross over someone else\\'s retractable/lanyard. As well as fall protection, use proper fasteners and techniques if you build scaffold on the side of a house.\\n\\n\\nTrue story...\\n\\n\\nBro was in the back that day, setting windows with a man we\\'ll call Dumbass. So it was, Dumbass was told to build a scaffold up there so they could place all the windows. Up there. On the second floor.\\n\\n\\nSure enough, they were up there, on the second floor scaffold, my brother and Dumbass there, and it went all crashing to the ground.\\n\\n\\nBro noticed after it all fell, that there weren\\'t but 8p nails holding everything together...\\n\\n\\n\"Dumbass, why didn\\'t you use 16p nails?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All I had on me was the 8p\\'s, so I just used twice as many.\" I guess he can math, he just can\\'t reason.\\n\\n\\nBro still complains of the back pain he formed that day, and it\\'s been long enough to have us two more brothers die since. I used to think tying off on a lift was redundant. That was until, while still learning the boom lift, I went off a curb just a touch too fast. I didn\\'t go more than a few inches airborne, but the potential of it hit me immediately. As did the importance of going super slow at crucial times, and wearing that damn harness. The only people that have problems following safety protocols are usually hacks that think they are gods give to us all and are so good. Haha oh man. Don‚Äôt you know all this safety stuff actually makes my job more dangerous? No, it\\'ll stay. It\\'s good sharing info. I\\'ve seen this practice save lives......my own included. I\\'ve seen guys get hurt from it as well. But, they are alive. My gear has saved my ass more than once. Probably a little late to the party with this comment here, but what really enforced tying off for me was seeing one of my older coworkers who could barely walk, hobble around a job site. Guy had fallen about 35 feet onto the ground. Was painful just to watch him take a few steps. It‚Äôs those little tasks where you‚Äôre only going to be by the edge for a few seconds where something goes wrong. Scissor lift? Nah\\n\\nJLG? Sure I never seen anyone tie off in the years I‚Äôve been working. \\n\\nI guess that‚Äôs something Union guys do Drunk you says what sober me thinks. I always felt kind of nerdy thinking it though.  Stay safe brah Sitting here at my desk. Wish I was that drunk! Sadly, 7h to go untill I get out!\\n\\nWe love you too man! :) No, seriously. I love YOU üçª Hell yeah brother!\\n\\nFor most people life really is spent at home, working & sleeping. You should value each equally. Work shouldn\\'t just be a paycheck, but unfortunately for a lot it is. This community is mostly the people who take pride in their work. People who are passioniate about their trade. Who clearly spend their extra time of day on work when they don\\'t have to.\\n\\nEvery job is gonna have dramaqueens that wanna take out their problems on you or the slackoffs that cut major corners & give your occupation a bad name. Those that don\\'t care at all about being better. It\\'s not weird at all to appreciate this culture & comradery.\\n\\nYou SHOULD treat your coworkers like family. Doesn\\'t mean you are obligated, I just believe it\\'s a key to inner peace. And you SHOULD love waking up to work. It SHOULD feel like a second home. This kinda stuff has been around since the dawn of the internet, it\\'s pretty aesthetic here particularly imo. Lots of spontaneous fascination posted by cool people & stimulating discussions. This sub is awesome. We love you too, mate. Follow your bliss. Be well. =] CountMeIn I like that this sub captures all types of the industry from PMs, engineers/inspectors, labor and supers/foreman. I‚Äôve learned a decent bit here.   The camaraderie that develops when you spend all day with someone is special. I\\'m just an office guy these days but there was something even more special about working out in the field with the same people day in and out. They really do become your family if you let them. Lunches together, carrying the weight of tough days together, jamming out together - it wasn\\'t always the work, but what the work brought around. \\n\\nMy family has made its livelihood off of a trade and for that, it feels integral to who I am. It\\'s hard not to extend those feelings to anyone else in the trades. It reminds me of being a little boy out with my dad in the field connecting some outdoor lights at a shooting range. I\\'m rambling now too but yeah, I feel it.  Wonder if you‚Äôre just as hungover as I am today. Holy fuck How often you and your Union brothers do circle jerks? Nailed it. I heard you can shoot yourself with smaller gauge nails to build up immunity to larger gauges. Is 15 your next attempt? Noice. At least you didn\\'t nail your balls to your leg. I\\'ve witnessed that carnival.  Hey, uhhhh... your religion is showing...  It happens to the best of us... At least you had on those safety shorts and tennis shoes. Lol.\\n\\nYou just rubbed some dirt on it and get back to work or plan on seeing a doc? Young me was all about option A... Now I\\'m sitting here like, you can get a bad infection from that. lol Stop hitting yourself. Hope you‚Äôre up to date on your tetanus shot. If you don‚Äôt mind could you share the how part....I‚Äôm guessing you were holding the trigger and slipped. G‚Äôs apparently didn‚Äôt protect you! #MormonHumor  My boss has had a similar accident. He didn\\'t even notice shooting himself until he tried to take his pants of. The nail didn\\'t go through the fabric all the way so essentially he had non-removable pants then.\\n\\nI have just shot a nail through my finger. I was installing a ceiling paneling, the nail did an u-turn on a knot in the wood and came through my ring finger. Had to go to the ER with the panel I was installing. Ahh the old fast food napkin plus blue tape bandage, then when the blue tape ripped, it was re-engineered with duct tape.  Congrats! Haha. \\n\\nNever nailed myself but I‚Äôve stapled myself a few times.  Did it hurt?  Put one in my knee in front of my boss and the super of our job a few years back, take it easy on walking, gonna be reaaaaaal sore  Don‚Äôt worry about it. I shot a 3‚Äù paslode galvy ring shank through my hand into some decking. Nailed myself to the roof. I‚Äôll try and find the picture. \\n\\nEdit: here is the [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qa0i29u) \\n\\nStory time: My boss had to split the piece 1- 1/2‚Äù of decking around the nail and this was right before we snipped the nail back. It didn‚Äôt quite penetrate my middle finger on the other side of the wood but it left a mark. I was working on a small island off Vancouver Island and there was no hospital so we went to a medical clinic and ended up having two small old ladies pull it out in an aggravatingly slow manner. The rings in the nail did their job in the flesh. It wasn‚Äôt actually as painful as you‚Äôd think, just more of a pressure type pain. Oh and the reason it happened: I was using a framing gun with a bump trigger In my left hand ( I‚Äôm right handed) and the gun bounced after I shot the decking and landed on my hand. It took me awhile to live that one down on site but was back to work light duty within 2 days. I was told it was a right of passage and honestly was surprised how many people had done something similar. Be safe out there folks! Yes it going to be super sore as mentioned  When you move up to circular saws then you can brag This makes me very thankful to be in the office designing the trusses rather than framing them. Lol  Ah duct tape, the job site ‚Äòtussin.  That will be sore AF in the morning. Count your self lucky.  The last person that posted a shot myself with a nail gun got his knee.   Fuuck haha looks like it fuxking hurt! A coworker of mine got himself with a sheathing nail right through the 2nd knuckle of his left index. His finger was bent in a v shape at the time so the nail went like this\\n  |----/|--  through the back and out the front. Caught the bottom of the joint on the way by. NASTY and took a lot of therapy. Was fat for years.  Worst I got was hacking that same knuckle to the bone with an angle grinder. Hurt like a bitch for months. Wouldn\\'t want a nail to the thigh! Title was sarcasm  Needs more wire nuts O Yeah. That‚Äôs safer then smoking in bed!!!  Sub panel is especially clean. Would hire this homeowner. I love air splices! Y\\'all should recognize what is going on in this photo and stop the circlejerk.\\n\\nThe panel on the left is the old panel, with maybe 100A main. The panel on the right is a new panel with maybe a 200A service. If you look in upper right of the new panel, you will see the completed circuits; they look fine. The \"air\" connections are temporary to allow the homeowner to keep power while the new panel is being wired.\\n\\nWhat the hell is wrong with you guys, are you really this dumb? The only code he needs to worry about is Hammurabi\\'s Code. Who needs a junction box Codes are just a guideline or a suggestion.  Oh sweet baby Jesus.  What are those mains just hanging there to the left of the junction box!? Thank you for this. I truly needed to laugh & cry at the same time today. Not even close.  Welcome to the real world Better then some professional jobs I seen I would say that its an abomination and it needs to be killed with fire but I think that it will take care of itself... Yeeeeaaaaahhh... That\\'s called a fire hazard. Everyone out! Should be located below the hose bib shut offs, in case of fire I rented from this dude  Turn and walk away Need a professional electrician, LED lighting  design,supply and installation, solar panel installation as well, digital signage (Mall, shops), even for Christmas lighting sculpture please send an email to inq.goh@outlook.com\\n\\nAny gypsum and construction job,please let me know.\\n\\nWe are an international company base in Germany.\\n Lol. Why are you even asking? This is pure trash One time my dad nailed a baseboard in a finished house and pierced a bottle of piss in the wall. The piss all leaked out on the finished floor and stunk up the place. I was part of an adaptive reuse of an old high rise factory into 150 apartments - I\\'ve never seen so many piss bottles on a job.  My favorite bottle, by far, was on an exterior window sill on the top floor in a corner unit.  The windows were fixed and three was just enough piss that the bottle wasn\\'t moving.  It was too high to reach with a lift.  We ended up having to scaffold the entire face for an unrelated issue and, thank God, someone grabbed the bottle.  I think we all know who is responsible for this most of the time. Paying workers piece work should not be allowed. It is unsafe and creates a need to piss in bottles Construction manager for a large GC here. If I catch you doing that you are fucking fired and will never work on one of our projects again. Disgusting fucks, use the dozens of porto-johns we rent for you.  I don\\'t understand this. I\\'ve never asked my parents or anyone in my life for permission to go to the bathroom. I go. If you want to fire me over it, go the fuck ahead, but never will i ask. And i don\\'t bother with piss bottles.. If my employer cannot provide me with a proper bathroom, i\\'ll leave the jobsite and use the closest one and come back. piss bottles are only applicable until the bathtubs are installed  I work in the industrial side of construction and we really don\\'t have this problem. Our \"problem\" is people smoking in the port-a-cans. \\n\\nAfter saying that, I was laid off for a few months and a buddy asked if I could help out on this new apartment complex they were building. They client changed their mind about the single room apartments and wanted only a standing shower instead of a tub. So we were there to take them out. We removed about 40 tubs and every single one on the 3rd floor and up had been pissed in. The 4th floor was the worst. There was no \\nA/C and this was in July in Louisiana. After the job, I thanked my buddy but told him I would never do that again.  We have had to put up signs for pissing and spitting. \\n\\nAs a girl, when I moved from pre-construction bids to be a fit out manager on site I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd have to hold my breath as much as I do when walking around dark, small plantrooms.  Shit we had a fully functional restroom with running water and flush toilets and urinals.... was on L1 of a high rise Reno... as soon as we started L4 piss bottles everywhere  We did a condo on the 17th floor of a high rise where there was no toilet in the unit for about a week. I found a bucket, a fucking five gallon bucket that was about half full of shit and piss tucked under the master vanity.  if you piss in a bottle, throw it in the bin.  Avoid the fire stairs at all costs How about the drywallers who piss in the glue tubes and shit in the mud boxes. A general picked up one of the tubes once and spilled piss on his hand. He was livid. Lol I had capped a 4\" soil pipe,  built a large set of concrete stairs on top of the pipe end and 2 months later as the job was finishing, had to cut out a channel and put some surface drainage in. I could smell piss. Piss everywhere. I\\'m pretty junior so thought I had fucked up the capping. Was ready to fire up the core drill / still saw to expose my \\'mistake\\' when the plasterer told me my filthy fuck joiner had been pissing in there every day. The main future entrance door to a residential property. Fuck that guy, and fuck the 40lbs of pissy sand I had to dig out and bag up.  Working in multifamily this is just the norm, no matter how many portapotties I have on site Do you all of your jobs not pay for Porto potties? WTF? People also like to piss in electrical stub outs on big jobs.\\n\\nI blasted some serious air into a 3\" conduit with a 50hp compressor one day. Turns out someone was pissing into the other end at the same time. \\n\\nI was told that the guy ran out from behind the building gagging, without his hat and, soaked from the knees up. I can only hope that he was the first to piss in that particular pipe and that the rest was just water... \\n\\nBuuuut let\\'s be serious, it was a big job and those stubs were in a prime pissing location. Without being racist.....\\nAsians. Thats why the companys over here are in charge to put up Toilets. \\nAnd because they know ppl are lazy.. \\nhttp://atlastoilets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Urinal-on-wheels-PeeOne.jpg  like this one, can be used nearly everythere.  Honestly, it sounds like tour doing a lot in the way of giving things. I would make an effort to make some of your efforts more meaningful. Yes a tumbler is nice, but giving specific examples of why an employee was safe and what that really means can do wonders for morale. Hi, I am currently working on alleviating these problems in construction through technology. Would you mind sharing your experience over a quick call ? >That restaurant had also undergone a fire inspection without a given notice (I think somewhere in between late December 2019 to early 2020) as they had informed me that everything was up to standards. No certification was given to me after the inspection though.\\n\\nJust to clarify this was done by a fire marshal or inspector? If so try contacting them and asking for some documentation.\\n\\nSorry from the US so dont k ow what yoyr requirements are.\\n\\nI would also suggest asking in r/healthandsafety You would want someone who is qualified to understand the requirements. A firefighter sure could be used to make such an assessment. Create a similar document and have them fill it out along with their qualifications'"

       "'\"GC to coordinate\" LPT: Let the engineer know that their details suck. A good engineer will listen and update them on future projects if they can. \"GC to submit calculations and shop drawings for approval by structural\"  Fuck you design it yourself Then they ignore your calls and laugh hysterically I\\'m working on one right now where GC to submit submittals for all firestopping. Fine and dandy.  Except where arch wants a 3hr firewall to die into an unrated exterior metal curtain wall (PEMB) and it just isn\\'t possible. Not even with an judgement by Hilti/3M. There are details for spandrels but this isn\\'t that.  Sure the GC should have pointed that out earlier before building it but god-damn, open the firestopping book before drawing the impossible. As an engineer part of the problem is the 35% design/build proposal.  Basically we take a design to 35% whereby it gets passed on to a D/B contractor to finish  Where it hurts is that it\\'s difficult to figure how far to go on it because at the end of the day you\\'re not really taking any risk FFP: Fucking Field Problem.   The motto of design phase managers. Verify in field, sucker. Had to do an engineered pick at a Nuke plant.  Told responsible engineer his dimensions/measurements were off due to potentially reversing a couple numbers.  Ex lists space as 26\\'4\" but space is really 24\\'6\".  Told him container would not fit where it was expected to be placed and asked for solution. We need permission to do just about anything at a Nuke plant especially if it\\'s a change.  Engineer tells me as he\\'s siging pick sheet to just do my job, he\\'s the engineer, etc etc.   He didn\\'t realize that I had modified the sheet to state what I told him and that he is responsible for any damage caused as it was a directive and I was trying not to be insubordinate.   Mind you, this isn\\'t on the \"hot\" side  and we are decommisioning the plant so no risk of fuel exposure or a melt down.  We put box were we were told and crushed a small retaining wall in the process.   Whole job gets shut down for a week while it gets investigated.  Engineer gets fired, OE and I (and all other people on site) get \"retrained\" on what to do if this type if thing happens again and we are ALL authorized NOT to do what we are told if it is deemed unsafe. When you‚Äôre walking the job, mention minor changes, they say, ‚Äúsure, no problem‚Äù then during final walk they‚Äôre like ‚Äúwtf is this?! Why didn‚Äôt you follow the prints?!‚Äù You can be happy knowing the architect likely does the same shit to the engineer and whoever is funding the project makes all kinds of absurd requests of the architect. jUsT fOlLoW tHe PrInTs ‚ÄúYes I know the waterline is 2 feet down and you need to make it go down 12ft, you can manage that right?‚Äù Architect\\'s are the morons who do this. \"Let\\'s put a 15 feet cantilever beam for a better elevation\" This is more of an Architect\\'s joke. Unfortunately it\\'s a race to the bottom on fees. Often the first thing to go is the site visit at the start to clarify that the plans match as the architect wants value for money and thinks Thier plans are always spot on. Then we end up having to go back a forth with multiple parties trying to clarify things and we just get told different stories. Sometimes I wish the contractors were more involved in the design just so we can hash out the details more effectively. Especially as a young engineer we are not taught in school how things are actually built so what we learn is essential through trial and error and what the old hands in the company say. If the fee allowed us to actually do the job well instead of just fast then most issues on site would be mitigated. When we don\\'t have the time to actually do the job well we rely on caveats to save us from insurance issues and that is an inherent flaw with the industry at the moment. We are lucky to get 1% of the fee yet are expected to take such high risk. Often the call comes from management and we are offered like lambs to the slaughter to the GC when our work matches the fee. If you want better designs then someone needs to pay for it! ‚ÄúYeah let‚Äôs just wait for the RFIs and CCOs‚Äù My position is specifically stated to take drawings that are 30 years old, 80% complete, or not for the project and operate at a higher level to fill in the gaps. Get paid good, going to be paid more soon. Blame the client. They don‚Äôt want to pay us. ‚ÄúContractor to field verify‚Äù  Shit rolls down hill, I‚Äôve got two projects the architects changed the floorplans/entrances on after we finished final construction plans. Without telling us. Shouldn‚Äôt this say Architects they cause all the problems You‚Äôve misspelled Architects! Looked good in CAD Verify in field Biggest pet peeve. Should be a requirement to turn a wrench for like 6 months to be an engineer. I‚Äôm looking at you Lennox... \"Making sure they don\\'t get their pants sued off\" Bruh, putting beefy gutters on some wack eaves is hell Reversed plans I had an engineer from Wirtgen out on a job with me once and he was pretty much a master mechanic. And then there is me, a drawftsmen that has a solution and the engineer and construction firm accept my detail  If you ever worked on your own shit with your own plans you learn quick.... Looking at the guys who drew up the plans for the reo. Amen We had a 60ft 8 tonne scroll snap in two. The engineers didn‚Äôt think a hoist or removable floor grates would be required to remove it when the plant was designed. So naturally we had to take 2 stories off the building to lift it out. Turned a 4 day job into a 2 month one It\\'s time for 3d plans. They don\\'t even know the reality of the actual job vs what the print says haha Over the last 15 years I have owned Craftsman, Hitachi, DeWalt, Porter Cable and Milwaukee.  I have used Makita, Panasonic and Ridgid as well... Now I own about $7500 worth of Milwaukee .... If they ever change batteries I am going to cry and then switch to Ridgid! Funny thing is I hear so many mixed opinions of Ryobi tools by pros and homeowners. I don\\'t know what to believe now [deleted] An old lead hand always used Ryobi because he was tired of his Makitas getting stolen. ‚ÄúI buy all my stuff at Harbor Freight, it‚Äôs a great store!‚Äù [Here‚Äôs the relationship between tool companies](https://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Who-Owns-What-Tool-Brands-2019-Update-2.jpg)   I‚Äôve seen people shoot themselves in the foot and say Milwaukee is trash and ryobi is better and it‚Äôs just about the name or DeWalt breaks all the time and porter cable is a really old and good brand.   I think it‚Äôs important to realize that ryobi is made and manufactured by the umbrella company as Milwaukee. That doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre the same and milwaukee is crap and uses cheap ryobi parts or that ryobi is really good and uses good pro level milwaukee parts. They are different brands and different companies but owned by the same umbrella corp so they have different tools and different designs and different price points. TTI also makes tools for Ridgid which is owned by Emerson.   They‚Äôre both good but you need to realize that ryobi is not a pro level tool and they acknowledge that on their own brand description whereas milwaukee is a pro level tool and designs it to be a pro tool. Haha I think this is one of those scenarios where ‚Äúif it works for what you need it for‚Äù then it‚Äôs great. For example, I was given a fairly new Ryobi battery brad gun. Day to day I use a compressor and that dewalt brad gun, but when I‚Äôve had to run to a house quick for a little finishing touch that battery gun has been phenomenal ü§∑üèª\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I agree that ryobi tools are cheap and lesser than many others in quality. That being said, I‚Äôve got a few ryobi tools that have stood the test of time in regular use.  Now, black and decker, that‚Äôs pure uselessness Ryobi Japan makes some really nice tools like mortisers and beam saws that are some of the best around.    Milwaukee and Ryobi North America are owned by the same company, and their tools made in the same factory in China. Moore like \"I\\'m handy, I build my own porch!\" A friend of mine has a ton of the new Ryobi stuff. Honestly it‚Äôs not bad at all for homeowner level work. Doesn‚Äôt Milwaukee own them? I\\'ve had the same 6 piece Ryobi set for about 4-5 years now with no issues, but I\\'m in maintenance and not new construction.  They\\'ve never let me down or failed to perform when I\\'ve had them on the job site. Dad built a deck out back of his house and some of my Ryobi stuff became critically necessary. Their oscillating handle with the right angle impact driver (combination Ryobi and Ridgid) was sinking screws in tight spaces that otherwise wouldn\\'t be possible.  I will say that the regular impact driver is still a little short on torque.  Ryobi seems to get shit on a lot and I get where it\\'s coming from, but for an apprentice trying to break into the field I recommend Ryobi to people because they can get the tools they need to earn those first paychecks and maybe start putting money away to purchase a better more industrial tool set.  Ridgid has struck me as having excellent build quality and a great warranty on their power tools, can anyone recommend for/against a Ridgid set as an eventual upgrade to Ryobi? I\\'ve gone through a lot of different drills. Dewalt has been the best performing, for the cost, in my experience. Especially when you take advantage of black friday or fatersay deals. This is very specific... No offense to the people that like ryobi, but when I see someone bring ryobi tools on the job I just assume they are just getting started in the construction business. If it works use it but if you need it to last for a long time buy nicer stuff. To me you will look more professional with higher quality tools and if you want repeat business then you need to think about stuff like that. They make a nice hot glue gun I was a DeWalt guy when I was in the business, but now that I\\'m just a homeowner, I\\'ve slowly replaced my collection with Ryobi over the years as stuff stopped working or replacement batteries cost as much as new tools.  I still have my Dewalt impact driver which is going strong and a corded circular saw.  Most other stuff is now Ryobi including my lawnmower and other yard tools.    I can\\'t really complain at all about them - they are plenty accurate and precise and durable enough for my uses.  I have no idea how they would fare in a full-time work environment where durability and long-term reliability under heavy use are critical features. Yeah ummm...  TTI makes Ryobi, Milwaukee, Rigid, and a number of other cordless tool brands.  So avoid Ryobi if you dislike lime green. I really felt this I like the Ryobi cordless nailers, that they balk at the last second if you let go of the trigger, you don\\'t have to turn it on and you can rig the safety by swapping it with the flashlight button looks at my Makita  looks at my office\\'s Bosch I‚Äôve not had single problem with my tools ever (for past two decades), beside regular maintenance, with exceptions. Each tool is taken care of and used for its purpose, without intentional abuse. I own most mainstream brands, including Ryobi. The exception is when I lent it, so I don‚Äôt. Ryobi is starting to grow on me..   Residential GC, and a lot of our subs use Ryobi everything. Plumbers specifically and punch out trim guys. Great cordless nailers and a swath of any tool imaginable at this point it seems.   My Milwaukee and Dewalt tools get worked all day everyday, and have never had problems. Trim nail guns to sawzall and impact guns.   But I must say I‚Äôve used ryobi cordless miter saw, and the 18g nailer for some cabinetry crown punch out, and I was very impressed. Im a California GC. My carpenters helper has ryobi tools. The green tools.  He swore by them for his home projects. He finished his small projects and let his tools sit for a while. When he tried starting a new project at his house, all of his batteries decided they were retired. So, he spent half the money to buy a new, quality set of tools on new ryobi batteries. He used them for his project, but started burning up his tools. This stubborn ass kept buying ryobi stuff because now he had new batteries.   It was a couple years later when he got his first set of Dewalt and that\\'s when he realized what I\\'d been trying to tell him about tools and quality. \"A tool is a tool.\"  No. You get what you pay for. My boss has gone through 3 Ryobi powerwashers in 3 years. Like dude, it\\'s fine for your driveway and siding once a year. but 10 restaurants and 40 appt complexes?   Just get us a gas one lmao I can buy 5x ryobi powered caulking guns for the cost of the Milwaukee one, it ain‚Äôt 5 times better. Carrying that other battery charger around is annoying though.   I have their little dustbuster too cuz its cheap as hell like $30. When the thing dies from being choked to death by drywall dust I get another one, the festool vac my buddy had was like 500 bucks. Thats like 15 shitty dustbusters! What‚Äôs ironic is that when they first came out, (early-mid 90‚Äôs maybe?)they were pro level tools , and advertised as such in Fine Homebuilding magazine. I could probly find an ad in my magazine collection.   I bought the BT3000 table saw, which was like $600 (!) back then, and it was a great saw. Eventually it wore out, I bought the newer version, made in China, it still is working well, and two years ago picked up another older Japanese made mint condition bt3000 for $75 off Craigslist. Ryobi is good for company tools that may end up getting dropped off scaffolding. Hey my ryobi tools started me off just fine while I saved for Milwaukee Hi. I‚Äôm the rigid guy. Or, I might buy festool blah blah blah It\\'s amazing how people are brainwashed by brand names yet consider themselves independent. I have Ryobi, Hitachi, Makita, Milwaukee, Craftsman, Skil, DeWalt, Stihl and Harbor Freight power tools, and so far they\\'ve all held up pretty well. I‚Äôd rather use a rock than a ryobi I actually think Ryobi has some pretty nice woodworking tools. I have a few tools that I bought in a combo set that I had to buy in a pinch.. still working 6 years later. Do I prefer my Dewalt tools for my woodworking or my Milwaukee for all the other stuff? Yes.   Would I pick up my Ryobi if it\\'s what was near by? Yes. definitely not that guy but for what I do they work fine but that‚Äôs exactly how I phrase it I thought this was a cuck post at first My response is always \"My wife has a nice set of Ryobi\" You do realize ryobi is literally owned by Milwaukee right? And they are essentially the same tools, with a lower price tag. This is on the poster to get you to sign up to be in construction. And then....the real world. Looks like just about time for sparky to come in and fuck it aaalll up. I have to assume this was an elaborate april fools day prank on a laborer where you all went and worked on another job site without telling them and they then spent the day cleaning up while they were waiting for everyone to show up...Its the only explanation that makes any sense to me. I can smell this picture Job site looks like paradise. Location looks like paradise. That\\'s it everyone is fired.. that includes you snow!! Your HVAC guys are gonna have a nightmare on their hands with all those headers and joist changes. I can drill a 5 inch hole in thoae beams for my 4 inch main right? A safe job is a clean job. Just wait till the electricians show up.  Drives my wife nuts.  If I\\'m doing honey do lists for I just drop what I don\\'t need wherever I am standing.  A habit that is hard to break. Ughhh I hate tryin to nail staples into TGIs. Knock outs never line up Jesus those are some long TJIs That\\'s why I\\'m solo. All my sites look like this..... most of the time.... if no one fucks with my system..... my sites never look like this. I can safely say I‚Äôve never once  seen  a job site this clean and organized Oh my god, this is such a wholesome subreddit. Of course its clean. Wait when its rough in time Looks like a swanky beach house? Gotta pay for quality. It is impossible that this will last Quit taking pictures and get back to work. and everything began getting disorganized again the minute after this photo was taken üòÇ A clean job is a happy job This is amazing. This house looks like a nightmare to run wires in If they love it so much, why don\\'t they keep a clean and organized job site? Wait till messy ass meps‚Äôs get to it! You know? I always thought about doing a ranking of the most messy/rough in the workplace and then a comparative table with Lord Of The Rings species. Like for example, we, the painters would be the Elfs (no less than that ofc.) Masons would be some big strong orc etc. This is like immediately after delivery on a monday I fucking hate Zipwall... Is this a dream?  Is it possible to learn this power? No MEP? Needs more piss bottles Beautiful! Oh so nothing is getting done. Nice stacking job. Can I come work with you? Reminds me of one of my job sites......I miss it. THIS.  Every day. A clean jobsite is a happy jobsite ..makes everything go smoothly.  Also train the men to clean a little bit every end of day and it can stay like that till completion It makes it convenient for scumbags to steal when you leave the job site for the night.... [deleted] The Safety Squint He\\'s forgetting to turn his head slightly to the side. This reminds me of the looks I got from the welders when I told them face shields while using cut off wheels was not optional...I ended up quitting after someone took a hot piece of steel into the ear while torching upside down w/o ear protection. It‚Äôs like everyone took pride in saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù to safety Who here has done a little grinding with their eyes closed because the glasses are all the way across the room? Grind, stop and check. Grind, stop and check.  I mean, I\\'d never be that lazy... Just curious if anyone else has?  I had crap pulled out of my eye twice last year from ricochets under my safety glasses. I\\'m pretty careful these days, even using a full shield on occasion.  Where is our full cobra commander helmet that the face is perfectly clear, except when auto-shading to the exact tint for acetylene/plasma/welding??? I\\'d pay like, at least $100 for that! Maybe a bit more if it was mirrored and really did look like a cobra commander helmet. That\\'s my weed eater face! It‚Äôs just like how you don‚Äôt need a respirator if you breathe through your nose right? The nose hairs catch it or something. I love you for this This is me. It doesn\\'t stop with glasses. I used to be like that, but after having to go to the hospital cus of some metal in my eye I\\'ve decided to always wear my goggles from now on Hahaha.   Team squint here!  Happy to report it has always worked Figured the line was ‚ÄúI use a bong‚Äù Lost an eye in 2012. My Dad was putting a 3.5\" hand nail into the wall, gave it a good swing and it pinged off. Back over his shoulder 10\\' and the head of the nail ripped the front of my eyeball off while it was spinning. Wear your fucking safety glasses. Also, be thankful you can afford to lose one. I laughed way too loud at this. üòÇüòÇ Who is the other actor here besides Leonardo decaprio? thought safety was an afterthought and it didnt apply to me... until one of guys I carpooled with during first year carpentry had a partial zip disk in his safety glasses... But you aren\\'t a J-man without a story of what not to do So dumb but so true Thank you! Had a piece of metal from drilling steel plate lodge into my cornea. Doctor removed it by flicking it out with a needle. By that time a rust ring formed. Proceeded to have that ground out of my eye with what was basically a mini dreamer tool. I don‚Äôt fuck around with the safety squint anymore. take your upvote, you savage. i have a hard time seeing/keeping things straight through goggles and wear them only when absolutely necesary. It‚Äôs perfect. Hit it with some clear sealer and sell it to the hipsters. nice butt bro THICC Do dump trucks usually come to demos? Homie got a WAGON üòç Them hips don\\'t lie. How you doin\\'... That‚Äôs some fine ass art right there. As assinine as most modern art Nice. Can I sniff it? /r/Dontputyourdickinthat cccccccccccccccc Dat ass tho Damn Boi! There\\'s a hole in your pants. You\\'re welcome. My GF said ‚Äúnice butt‚Äù.  Please don‚Äôt steal her. I would crop, frame and hang it on the wall. I must say, as a straight man, I can still appreciate the pertness of your behind. Work it, gurl. Dude. Nice ass Positively bodacious. You should be proud Reminiscent of the album cover for Born in the USA. because the dust is very thick? Spray that with clear lacquer before someone opens a window For a second I thought r/diwhy Yes, dat ass is truly art nice ass bro Sheesh, that‚Äôs so good you can almost tell the gender. Who left a pair of black Levi‚Äôs on this chair?! Hey man you should clip your laces or tuck then in....I have had some brutal falls due to laces...... stay safe Took me a little too long to realize that isnt a folded pair of jeans. 18\"x20\" loose grit on wood, titled \"Work\", 2020. Nice butt dude. Do you poop with that thing? Thiiiiic boiii Lol üòÇ that did turn out pretty cool. It\\'s nice that you think your ass is art, but try not to be so self-absorbed. ;) Big butt [deleted] I‚Äôm an ER nurse and the praise is ridiculous.   I was also a firefighter, and I would cringe at the stickers on firefighters vehicles, it‚Äôs  is ridiculously embarrassing. Beyond pride,   Firefighters will even get married in their uniform.   Mailmen don‚Äôt get married in their uniform. Lol  I‚Äôm just doing a job I was trained to do, and we all have our place in the world to keep it going. As a construction worker, I\\'m torn between still having a paycheck and the crushing anxiety of continuing to report to work... Yeah ive been amazed to see how many people are complaining about not getting mentioned in the media for being ‚Äúessential‚Äù. No one cares if the wall is leveled bob people are dying. The pizza guy is pissed that he doesn\\'t get a spot. I could care less about gratification, it‚Äôs the people that see us as dirt workers that piss me off cause how are you about to live in a city built by construction workers  while living in a house built by construction workers and look down on them. I dont want a medal... or a cookie... or brownie points... or a pat on the back... I want an extra 10-20% on top as hazard pay.  Thankyou please. Meanwhile, the grocery store worker restocks the shelf of giant champagne bottles. #don\\'t forget to salute your heroic uber eats driver https://www.today.com/health/only-silver-why-second-place-feels-worse-bronze-2D12092210 There are plenty of construction workers literally building COVID facilities in or around medical facilities too. But i agree with everyone saying they‚Äôd just want more pay, less praise. I\\'m a medic. The praise is patronizing. I ran into a gas leak last month to rip a guy out of the house. Management almost wrote us up and tore a strip off me in the hallway. The patient would\\'ve been dead if they were in there much longer, he was at 30% blood CO concentration.   Now I\\'m a hero for going into every dickhead with a colds house to check their temp without the proper PPE.  I left construction to make a bigger difference (hindsight lmao), now I\\'m getting ass fucked by the country Ive worked my ass off to keep safe for years. And yet truck driver is nowhere to be found. We just out here. The booze is pretty relevant too. Only a construction worker would post this... And then pee on it This is one of the other facets of rich ruling class getting the poor and disenfranchised to blame each other or hate on those they are told are ‚Äúlesser‚Äù than them.  This is the part where they seek daddy‚Äôs approval. Yep *clapping intensifies* I was a Journeyman Union Laborer and was one of the 1st in New England to go through the apprenticeship program.  You\\'re damn right I was proud to be  Laborer, but it didnt/doesn\\'t define me.   If you are proud of whatever it is that you are or do, that\\'s great and more power to you. Well, construction workers do help to build the buildings that are needed to work in their environments. You don\\'t get extra credit for doing your job. Majestic! I\\'ve never seen one in their natural habitat. That\\'s the kind of picture a sub sends me at 3:15 on a Friday. What does it eat? The Genie is back in the bottle. Alkalinity is a little high in this pool ... Crazy how nature do that. Is the GS 1930 short for Genie Submarine, 1930 being the safe permissible depth of submergence. #Cannonball! There\\'s some water for your fucking batteries, BILL! Best photo I‚Äôve seen today ! Luckily the idiot that does this won‚Äôt have his fall protection strapped to the lift pulling him under I don\\'t know if you\\'re getting your deposit back ‚ÄúThese things happen on big jobs‚Äù Someone\\'s having a bad day That looks expensive nature is healing itself The plumbers strike again ü§¶üèª\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è We had a customer sink a rental boom when 2 pumps failed When your work quality is so deficient the newbie on site calls you out Just because you‚Äôve always done it that way, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve always done it right. Do the job you get paid to do correctly. Very refreshing to see highest voted comments are about letting the inspectors do their jobs. Maybe you should just do your work so that it\\'s in compliance with spec/code to begin with. I went from residential construction (10 years) to building envelope consultant and this is what I did for a while. Zero experience with commercial roofing to doing construction administration on multi million dollar projects. I relied heavily on manufacturers requirements that I read in the days before the projects started. The biggest thing I think I did correctly was to not be a dick, and just talk with the foreman. They were Usually pretty cool. I would say the majority of the time when I have to deal with an inspector one on one in commercial masonry, it\\'s just to give them samples of mortar or grout or getting photographs of our rebar prior to grouting. But when I have butted heads with them it was because the spec book was obviously cut and pasted from a different project. One instance in particular was a specification book that had an unlabeled set of materials for restoration in it and our project was strictly new construction. I had to sit down with them and explain that this product was for repair of deteriorating CMU, and everything here is new work. This product was for seismic retrofitting of masonry with cracks in it. Even called a few material representatives to bring them in on the conversation. Went a long way to give them a look that we were putting in the work correctly and that we understood what was needed on the project to build it per code. As well as giving them a small education on the purposes of some of the products in the specifications. They took notes for future reference.   &#x200B;  It could have started out as a sour experience but ended in them taking a few notes, us seeing eye to eye and shaking hands at the end of the day. I\\'ve since seen her on sites and there\\'s always a joke about what class will be on this time. I had to do inspections on my internship and I actually liked it. The guys didn‚Äôt like me, but the foreman didn‚Äôt mind and often were pretty helpful. Do it right, do it light. Man some of yall really hate inspectors huh? If you\\'ve done it right just show them the code, otherwise let them do their job. It\\'s fun being an inspector and an ex-ironworker, I tell the guys I can do their job *and* mine the company wanted to be able to bill for an inspector on site so they sent me out. I‚Äôm a survey party chief.   8 hours of milling I didn‚Äôt say one word. I took pictures and forwarded them to the PE. I had a rookie inspector on a job recently... Over the project I had several really inane deficiencies written by her. She was trained as an electrician but was inspecting my structural stuff specifically a set of stairs.   The one that bugged me the most was this. She wrote me a deficiency and copied the world on it, for my stair grabrails being 37\" from stair nose to top of the grab rail and our shop drawing shows 36\" so it HAD to be fixed so they are installed at 36\". She even included pictures of her tape measure and the rail.  I wrote back that per ADA i had anywhere between 34\" to 38\" to top of rail in order to meet code and yes 36\" is nominal if it is achievable but either way 37\" was well within code requirements. I also added that if she would care to look at the drawings a little closer she would see that the stair steps are to have a 1\" oak tread applied over our steel and as you could see from the pictures, the oak was not installed yet. Add the 1\" oak and you get 36\"... And to pile it on, i noted that it was irresponsible to be writing someone a deficiency on any items dimensions if your not talking into account the thickness any items yet to be installed.    Hit reply all..... Didn\\'t have any other stupid deficiencies like that the rest of that project. Better to be going by the books and get paid when the books are wrong than to go off the books then have to pay for your mistakes. This is my favorite:  \"I\\'ve been doing this for 30 years\"  \"Great, you\\'ve been doing it wrong for 30 years\" I first started doing inspections at 22 getting paid $11/hr. Learned real quick that if you have confidence and enjoy hanging out and asking questions you\\'ll rarely have a problem. If you come in insecure, you\\'re about as useful as a cock flavored lollypop Younger inspectors are generally more pliable and look at this as their job. Most older inspectors are broken down tradesmen that look at it as a working retirement and they don\\'t follow-up with any continuing education. Regulations are written in blood. They are there for a reason. Mfw the inspector comes in and fails us for a panel with a two pole breaker and says the spare at the bottom needs to be labelled as Spare on the panel I do forming and shoring design work. Always surprises me that there aren‚Äôt more failures at job sites. Went to inspection on stadium job site,  3rd deck 24‚Äù x 48‚Äù cast in place beam 25ft high being poured. Spent months working on the design work. Workers mostly Ignored the plans. On one section Instead of using  our heavy duty shoring legs had a timber 4‚Äùx4‚Äùx6‚Äô on last part of the stack up. After hearing the I‚Äôve been doing this 25 years speech workers scrambled to fix it. I was just flabbergasted. I did a job a while back where the owner was suing the previous GC due to the EIFS system failing. The guy hired all sorts of 3rd party inspectors, including a guy who sat on the EIFS council of Canada, a window testing agency and a roof inspector and they paid for the manufacturers extended warranty so we had to fly their technical rep out for inspections along with the rest of the yahoos. My Super couldn\\'t wipe his ass without 3 people telling him how to do it. My Sub is by far the biggest and best EIFS trade in the province too, half of the details in the manual are his and of the \\\\~$15 million of work I\\'ve hired him for over the years, he\\'s yet to do wrong by me and we chose him specifically due to the complexity of this project.  We ran into a pretty unique condition, where 2 buildings joined and there was a window that pretty much required a window well constructed into the roof. It was essentially a submarine window but the Arch insisted it had the same top line as the ones that weren\\'t sunk into the building. A previous expansion of the building was a big part of the issues obviously. The whole thing was stupid but if they took the window out, they couldn\\'t rent out the meeting room apparently.  Anyways, we\\'re trying to figure what the hell to do with this thing. We flew everyone in to take a look. Called a site meeting. I made sure the owner was present because I knew this would be a lot of fun. We had 9 people standing on the roof looking at this sunken window and everyone was scratching their heads.  The guy from the EIFS council turned to my Sub and says \"Bob, I\\'m baffled by this one what would you do?\". I couldn\\'t help myself, I burst out laughing. I would wager the owner got a bill in excess of 20k all said and done from his consultants for this meeting and at the end of the day, they did the right thing and deferred to the guy who does it all day long.  &#x200B;  EDIT- Just noticed your username. Nice to see another mensch out there onsites lol. Inspectors make the owners happy. A happy inspector makes for a happy field engineer.   Do your job right the first time because it\\'s more expensive to fuck it up and re-do it. A lot of young guys in construction will get upset at the inspector for telling them they have to redo it. I used to be like that as well, getting upset because I don\\'t want to do something twice. But now I\\'m fucking happy as can be if I have to a job twice because I get paid twice to do the same job.   Yes it should have been done correctly the first time and we told boss man we probably should do it this way, but fuck it double the pay for a single job. Just remember we are always working ourselves out of a job. Might as well make it worth it. I don\\'t know how to cook but I can tell the chef did something wrong if my meal tastes like shit. I love how many down votes this is getting.  The people that post these kind of things don‚Äôt realize what it‚Äôs like being an owner of an expensive asset that needs to be protected.  Imagine you hire a crew that you pay upwards of $1,000,000 to paint a bridge or a water tank and they just decide to do whatever they want and the coating fails within a year because there was no inspector on site.  The contractor got away with your money and now you have to pay to get the job re done the right way.  In my experience the best results have come from Contractor and Inspector working together to get the project done right.  All parties have open communication at all times.  Not all contractors will rob an owner but they do exist.  I know if I‚Äôm an owner of an expensive asset that needs re-painting I‚Äôm hiring an inspector to make sure it gets done right.  If the coating fails we will at least know why and who‚Äôs at fault. I don‚Äôt need to know how to program a website in order to tell if it‚Äôs a piece of shit. An inspector doesn‚Äôt need to know how to install a hot water heater in order to determine if it was done wrong. Bro at the end of the day if your inspector doesn‚Äôt sign off on your shit then you‚Äôre fucking it up. My goal with all my inspectors is for them to see enough of my work that they stop bothering to even worry about checking it because they know I do a good job. Now they just show up to BS and sign some papers ü§ô Hey that‚Äôs me! And guess what I might not have ‚Äúwork experience‚Äù but I still know to use a tape measure when laying out a road. I fought a contractor for a month because he‚Äôd measure road widths with his foot and be 2‚Äô wide Nice meme, but why do you have a woman as the incompetent one. I mean construction has a problem with sexism in the worst way. As a structural engineer I‚Äôve had female staff with 20 years of experience showing an intern a construction site and there field team kept asking the intern. I mean come on! adjuster trainee checking in I\\'m a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:  - [/r/buildingcodes] [\"I\\'ve been doing it this way longer than you\\'ve been alive\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingCodes/comments/hwggzg/ive_been_doing_it_this_way_longer_than_youve_been/)  &nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don\\'t vote in the other threads.) ^\\\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* As a quality manager the comments in here are refreshing lol. The book being the drawing and specification. I feel attacked Can I ask how much you get paid as an inspector? I am an apprentice carpenter right now and is something I want to do down the line when I have my ticket. First job as the QC manager.      This is going on my wall. They probably are doing it wrong. Especially if they get real mad when you call them out. This is literally me right now, I\\'m 4 months in to being a commercial inspector for my state and I\\'m inspecting multi-million dollar jobs and feel way in over my head haha I know a guy who started a roof Monday. Drawings were terrible so he asked client for clarification.  Clients asks can\\'t you read drawings.....!  The joiner is very rich, doesn\\'t need to work, was only helping someone out.  So tools packed up and away he went! I was always amused by architects and designers who said, ‚Äúbut it works on paper, look!‚Äù. Right here! I came from a trade background before becoming an engineer.  When I was a cadet doing site inspections, I was always really respectful and never pretended I knew more than the tradesmen. They respect that in return and whenever I found that some re-bar was incorrect or missing or whatever, they just appreciated me finding the mistake. I wish. No booze at work. Even the holidays.  We had a party chief get a dui. We had to pick him up every day. He lived 45 minutes in the opposite direct of our job sites.   I did work for a guy on the side and one of the homeowner gave us beer. It was summer time, and a multi acre site. After 2 beers I was worthless. Having a ticket for a trade should be a requirement for safety officer  positions. A lot of times we‚Äôre engineers send the younger guys and girls to do the inspections so they can get field experience (and so we don‚Äôt have to get off our lazy assess and do it). I chuckle at the comments too. Comply or RFI I honestly haven\\'t had any issues with engineers like yeh they\\'re a pain sometimes, but usually they\\'re just trying to cover their ass which in turn covers our ass. I just wish the new ones were a bit more flexible and more willing to meet us halfway. Road Construction Inspector here, I don‚Äôt usually have these for the actual work it‚Äôs mostly compliance with things around the work like traffic control. I prepared myself really well for my first repar inspection. I caught alot of mistakes and had a huge list of To-Do for them. Felt pretty proud I as a construction manager, agree that these kinds of people suck. I basically call out the worker if they are doing something that the ‚Äûcontract giver‚Äú? (I dunno I‚Äòm german) won‚Äòt be happy to see, and will make things problematic. I‚Äòm never telling them they are doing it wrong, I tell them that technical regulations require a different approach. I had a probably 19 year old inspector on the ADC-Lewis job in Goodyear,AZ project checking slump for a 2 bag patch job.  When I asked him ‚Äúhow wet do you want this concrete?‚Äù He responded with ‚Äúwell how wet does the bag say to make it?‚Äù   I called his boss and his boss told me a 6‚Äù is fine I just came here to support anyone that gets harassed by the good old boy network on their first day, but the top comments pretty much have it taken care of.  &#x200B;  Can you imagine being so threatened by a rookie inspector?    OP got some quality issues on site for sure. It\\'s usually the 400 lb safety guy who\\'s harassing people. Engineers never give me grief. I had a superintendent with no experience attempt to threaten and scare me off of his site after he got one of my reports. Joke was on him, I recorded our conversation (legal in the state we were in). He ended up missing his completion date by 6 months and had to be a couple hundred thousand over budget. Ended up losing his job too.  Fuck that guy but he was my bitch after that recording came out. Lol. An inspector failed my wife on my work which was code compliant.  I left the other site and met her at city hall. Grab the chief inspector. While waiting, the guy waiting next to us is like \"new guy?\"  And we laughed.  And then his inspection got over-turned. The fact that a woman was used for this meme is really disappointing as a tradeswoman...even if the intent wasn\\'t specifically to slight women, it shows the bias that we all have to fight against every day to do our jobs. The look on a pissy junior PM\\'s face when his boss walks by and tells you that you\\'re doing incredible work. That feeling had me #glowup for the next freezing week.

Cheap owner, idiot engineer, clueless spec writer, green inspector. Go figure. This couldn\\'t be any more accurate. I just hate when completelt arbitrary or ambiguous codes are enforced by overzealous, or worse, blatantly incompetent inspectors.

That\\'s wheelie impressive. https://youtu.be/Rpszgytqkck this is quality oprerator Nice !!!!! That‚Äôs amazing! What a nut! I respect his skills.. I spent so long in excavators the foot controls for the bucket always killed me. We all agree this is a world wide thing right? Your being really generous with year 3 drywaller. Could also apply to painters...  Almost every painter that\\'s been on a site with me has been shitface drunk. Hell, the last foreman for the paint crew I worked with, would have fallen down a flight of stairs if I wouldn\\'t had steadied him. I really don\\'t know how GCs let them stay on site! Last job was at a nuclear power plant, too, where safety officials visited frequently. \"trunk slammers\" Concrete guys in Phoenix üòÇ ELI5 Lmao I sent this on to my drywalling friends. It‚Äôs spot on. On Alone season 3 there was a drywaller. You can tell immediately. Let‚Äôs please make a meme for each trade. Ty in advance Year 3 Drywaller looks like Billy from Stranger Things. Bro dry wall will dey you out try concrete Drywaller in Illinois https://images.app.goo.gl/Bsaju6E1P4CwiSDS7 Shoulda been \"year x addict\" instead with drywall as the title Then uses it in a presentation about potential hazards. gets praise. Sometimes they spray paint something orange. Lol the amount of things I‚Äôve had to stand on/in front of during photo time is ridiculous when I think about it I was on a job site and we were connecting two buildings by building a new one in the middle. So we have a gravel pit between the two putting in underground plumbing and to get in to the buildings we had to climb up 3‚Äô to get in or out. So the guys later a pallet against the wall. It‚Äôs like this for weeks, safety lady walks by it after awhile and is like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the pallet for?‚Äù I said ‚Äúpeople are using it as a ladder cause we don‚Äôt have a way to get in or out.‚Äù And she was like ‚Äúoh okay.‚Äù And walked off. No picture, no nothing. It stayed like that until they placed the concrete, and the GC breaks their arms patting themselves on the back about how safe they are. later, writes a report Safety man takes picture to later post on r/OSHA for mad upvotes? Paint it orange! As a residential framer I don‚Äôt understand this picture [deleted] I have had the same experience on big projects with the ‚Äúsafety inspectors.‚Äù Rarely any major safety hazards, but the main ones were ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù ladders. It is aggravating that a ‚Äúsafety inspector‚Äù will email my office to get me reprimanded, but won‚Äôt tell me about the violations and let me work with potentially compromised equipment all day. I worked with a GC that was Osha 10 to the T with some extras. Talking tied off above 6 feet, cut level 3 gloves, the whole 9. They caught me crawling on top of cable tray without being tied off (about 9 feet above the floor). Took a picture of me and never heard anything of it. Haha My company takes safety pretty seriously. As a PM, we do weekly safety audits on different crews. We have to take pictures of everything on our safety audit checklist to include in the report, and if there‚Äôs something not right, we have the crew fix it on the spot and take a picture of the corrected problem before we can leave. Pictures of literally everything: fire extinguisher inspection dates and locations, items in the first aid kits, pictures of everyone working to show they‚Äôre wearing PPE, the load charts and service records of machinery, etc. I‚Äôve seen one company that‚Äôs even stricter because their safety guy came on site and started taking things out of OUR work trailer and throwing stuff away because it wasn‚Äôt in THEIR compliance (they subbed us and we didn‚Äôt have their particular labels on safety cans and color codes on tools and extension cords even though we had our own system). In the end, they had to buy us new safety cans because their guy took them off site, but our guys put up a fight about the tools and called me to come sort it out. Most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever seen As a non-safety inspector, taking a picture of something deficient is one of the best ways to get it fixed. Everyone tries to argue until they see you photograph rebar sitting in mud. One of the safety guys for our glazers came out to do an audit of his peeps (glazers had been violating alot of safety rules and we asked for them to have a safety guy on site full time). This guy takes a video of his guys doing some unsafe as shit but doesnt stop them or say anything until they\\'re done. He then sends the video back to his office. Boy got laid into hard lmao. That ass got chewed the fuck out I think I\\'ve been lucky.  I\\'ve seen safety dude take pictures, but then he goes to the GC, who then disseminates the ass chewing through the contractor\\'s foreman, which rolls down the chain like shit on a hill.  Never been yelled at for not wearing gloves to do delicate work.  Got yelled at once for looping a tie off to the rail on a lift to get some travel, but that\\'s about it. I don\\'t get it. The safety man is covering up the safety hazard? Safety lady* I work in manufacturing. About 2 years ago my work went through some changes and all management and upper staff got radios. At some point one guy, a nice guy but a bit of a brown-noser, got a hold of a spare one. Just to have. To feel more important i guess. Alot of people had some fun with it. some even got some wood blocks and painted them black and would pretend to talk on them around him. Keep your radio, give me blueprints and leave me the fuck alone lol I won\\'t answer the radio unless they call me Captain Kirk. I\\'m definitely getting a superintendent vibe from the guy in the bottom right Nice pull bruh! This remind me, I should see if there are any new episodes of \"Refined\". I need a source on this pic! Expect if we get the radio it\\'s the bosses music only. Old ass country music.  Gotta be sneaky and play your own music just enough to hear it. Hahahahaha! Totally ten years ago This is every electrician or safety guy! Are you happy or upset? I\\'m truly confused and overthinking the guys emotion. I think they use essential instead of expendable to make us feel better My usual GC is taking some precautions, but we are being pressured to keep going. I just don‚Äôt want to go into anybody else‚Äôs house for a while. Electrician here, so glad to still be working, and it is funny that we are being called essential. Just got laid off. Our work is very essential but we‚Äôre just a big subcontractor so technically the complain who we work for is the essential one not us. Oh well Residential contractor here, I‚Äôm happy to still be working too. Absolutely the same feeling! You have encapsulated my essence https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2020/03/24/answering-8-questions-about-michigans-stay-at-home-order/  Q: Is construction allowed under the executive order?  A: Some limited forms of construction are permissible, including construction to maintain and improve essential public works like roads, bridges, the telecommunications infrastructure, and public health infrastructure. Construction workers may also undertake such projects as necessary to maintain and improve the safety, sanitation, and essential operations of residences. In addition, businesses may designate construction firms to provide necessary support to the work of the businesses‚Äô critical infrastructure workers. All construction work that is carried out while the order is in effect must be done in accordance with the mitigation measures required under section 5(c) of the order. I\\'m in heavy civil and we are busy with multiple subs on site. . We were happy to hear we are working until we are forced to shut down. But the governor just issued a stay at home order for all non essential workers. But he doesn\\'t define essential, so we will continue until we are forced to shut down. Civil engineer here. Happy to be still working I‚Äôm jealous. I was working doing renovations on homes and got laid off, and that was right before shtf. I tried to get my job back at an old company doing new home building and they said they‚Äôd love to have me back, and two days later told me they were on a hiring freeze. Residential super here. Business as usual except we are suppose to hang a sign in all our houses that says to stay 6\\' away from all people.  I also got moved to my own office since my co-workers desks were about 4ft away from me.   Grateful to be working though. I\\'m residential and got declared essential.   I\\'m not sure how I feel about it.  One hand I feel like we are just flooding a market while nobody is buying.  I\\'d rather not being working now while my family is sitting at home than later.    Other hand maybe I\\'m wrong and housing keeps rolling like this isn\\'t happening or didn\\'t happen. Welcome to the fire department :) I‚Äôm in residential remodeling. NY state says all trades are essential: plumbers, sparky‚Äôs, painters, carpenters, drywallers...I‚Äôm home for a week, then back to it. Just this past Friday my boss said we were done for a while. But when our president started to flip flop and panic about the economy, my boss fell in step and said we should just go back to work. Same with any construction for hospitals, while it‚Äôs nice to have something throughout the day to keep me busy I wouldn‚Äôt mind the time off either Building a totally unessential road in Australia while everyone I know either works from home or has lost their job. Feel lucky to still be making money (we are doing 12 hour days plus 6 Saturday) but can\\'t help feel uneasy that they are sending me to work while releasing prisoners to spare them from infection and nurses keep posting on social media for everyone to stay home so they can go to work. Fucken weird, conflicted feeling. Really feel like they should shut construction down like everyone else, but I can\\'t just stop turning up or I\\'d be out of a job when this shit cools down. This reminds me of the \"emergency paint job\" I had when a certain someone famous died and the funeral home needed to be freshened up. I haven\\'t felt this essential in years! In my area, essentially everyone is on the list. I suspect our public health officials are looking to make morgues great again. My first thought was ‚Äúnice. I wonder how long it will take them to do the MEP.‚Äù  My second thought was that I‚Äôm a dumbass. That‚Äôs mind blowing Do 9 Amish women also make a baby in a month? Any good bowlers in the bunch? Reminds me of Family Guy, where Peter blows up the barn and they build it this fast. I saw some trucks!   Sinners... Many men When in doubt, call the amish.... (via carrier pigeon) Many hands make work light. r/gifsthatendtoosoon r/gifsthatendtoosoon I live close to them and one of my job sites is right in their area. I was heading to work a couple weeks ago and it was so foggy I couldn‚Äôt see to drive faster than 30 mph. I said to myself when I got close to work that there will still be Amish in the roads so be careful. Sure enough I finally see the buggy about 20‚Äô in front of me and if I was going any faster I would have rear ended them. I can‚Äôt believe they feel safe enough with us English out on the roads not being able to see and go to wherever they were heading. I don‚Äôt know how nobody hit one on the road that morning. Thank the good lord for sure. No safety harnesses, no safety rails, no fall protection whatsoever.  Little wall bracing, virtually no roof bracing as the trusses are erected.  You can do a lot with free labor and no concern for worker safety. Must be nice to take a 2 hour lunch They got that up faster than the Chinese built the hospital in WuHan It‚Äôs jolly nice of the inspectors to stay on site all day so there were no hold ups. Must remind myself to do that next time. WOW My company has a big factory near Amish country in Kentucky & we‚Äôve used a crew of Amish guys to re-tar the roof. Apparently it was one of the quickest facility jobs we have ever had done. Big crews with a lot of ladders & ropes so the job was done in less than a day. Yes you can see their horses tied off at Walmart and many others stores in that area. They spend a lot of money in all these stores. I want to be Amish now \"\\'\\'Tis a fine barn, but \\'tis no pool, English.\"  \"D\\'ohth!\" They would be unstoppable if some one showed them a pocket calculator. It‚Äôs like ants. MFers are nutty doing that with no safety set ups. I suppose how can you with that many personnel? Lucky guys get 2 hours of lunch. I\\'m just going to state that this video started after all the time consuming work was done. Any underground utilities like plumbing, grounding rods, drainage,  ect... Excavation, footers poured and the concrete block wainscot laid (the gray parts of the wall) were all finished before this video started. your excitement, adds to my excitement of this :) I\\'ve wondered how tower cranes were anchored.   Thanks dude! Enjoy the build! We were just starting to prep for the crane base on our job...poured the mud slab on Friday. Then the forming trade informed us that they had to change the crane.....and the design of the crane pad would need to change after 2 months of back and forth on its design in the first place...it involves a deeper base so that mud slab now has to come out and we need to dewater lower....so so dumb. And the forming company had been charging us monthly to \"hold\" the crane. Clearly that was a money grab that hasn\\'t worked out for them because they\\'ll be paying for all rework and the schedule delay it\\'ll cause. I was so close to feeling this excitement of yours. What position are you? Sounds like a fun thing to watch, I‚Äôd be excited too!  Also, is there any more reinforcement/support than what‚Äôs pictured? Like, are there any micropiles or something underneath that slab, or is that area within the picture that‚Äôll be filled with concrete satisfactory enough to handle the load of the crane? Oh man that‚Äôs great! Stay stoked! Got an apprentice right now that loves learning everything an it‚Äôs awesome! He‚Äôs so hyped to learn as much as he can. Dude whatever you do don\\'t leave that site. I\\'ve seen so many guys start on a ground up - then when they finally get to envelope and the site is crowded with 10 times the guys they leave. But being on the crew in the ground to punch list on a job this scale is an experience you might be chasing for a decade if you don\\'t do it (cause I still am).   It\\'ll probably get harder, more frustrating, worse hours, client changes (although you\\'re already dealing with some serious CO\\'s by the sounds of it).   I\\'ve done more remodels than I can count, but only a handful of ground up - and I\\'m telling you I\\'d leave it all if I could be front line on this job.   But it\\'ll probably never happen for me, I moved from contractor, to owner side for  while, no I\\'m a PM for an architect, and being on site a couple hours a week doesnt come close. I\\'m surprised the base is actually poured into place instead of bolting. Do they chisel it out each time then? What‚Äôs the psi of that mix? So much going on here that I don\\'t understand. Why is the crane base cast on ground level instead of being below ground level like any normal foundation or column base? Why is there a section of crane mast being cast into the block of concrete instead of holding-down bolts to bolt the crane\\'s baseplate onto? I‚Äôve seen whalers break and walls implode on a pour like that. What a day that was. I think it\\'s leaning to the left a little. Quit being excited you fucking pussy. Now hurry the fuck up and pull the rod. It\\'s probably just the perspective, but this photo makes me want to stop the pump and check the plumb of that section one more time üôà Is it pile supported as well? Is this im Toronto? What GC do you work for?  Is that Downtown Los Angeles? Looks like a little Potain? That‚Äôs awesome I never knew the cemented those huge cranes into the ground. Makes sense. How many pounds will that crane be able to move ? Interesting that you are casting in the first section of the crane tower. All the crane bases on sites I‚Äôve been on (UK) we only cast in the holding down bolts. Have fun and be safe! I\\'m really surprised they didn\\'t put more kickers on their pans/forms when they poured. The forms like great though. Very well constructed from my pov. Field engineer here for a GC in Bay Area California. I get stoked on little things too. My super still does too, he‚Äôs the man. I‚Äôm on a TI job now but looking forward to a ground-up! Good post OP. Enjoy it! I\\'m a graduate engineer and I can\\'t wait to be exposed in the construction site! Definitely looks like SF. Whatcha building? Pretty freakin sweet guy  Damn that enterprise looking rough of the most beautiful things in engineering, the structures <3 Dont ever be ashamed of or loose that enthusiasm Good luck, guy! \\\\^\\\\^ Congrats! Wait til you have the mezz built. Keep taking pictures!!!!  If something goes wrong someone\\'s going to try to fuck you first.  With this picture you can show who was on site, what equipment they were using and that there definitely was X amount of rebar in the form, spaced properly and that it was vibrated.    Worst case you took a ton of pictures and have great material to share your excitement with a kindergarten class on Career Day or something. I really hope the top of the concrete base is well under the finished level (doesn\\'t look it!), otherwise enjoy breaking that out at the end of the project! Nice, keep us updated! Interesting, thanks. From the picture it doesn‚Äôt look that it‚Äôs much lower than the ground floor. I don\\'t see anything wrong with it. You could hammer any nail within a 6 foot radius and pry a nail out of concrete. Ah yes, the extremely sturdy no. 2 yellow pine hammer... that‚Äôs a top-shelf product there my man. I think you\\'re a good friend. If it\\'s going to be used for hitting nails, I hope he\\'s got good accuracy. Ingineearring Nailed it. Looks great for nailing the top of braces Nice can get some velocity with that one! How long handle 18 in ha I bet Thor would not be able to wield that bad boy. He isn\\'t a railroad steel driver is he? The folks over at r/DiWHY would probably love your work. Not long enough Skookum Looks great and now he doesn‚Äôt even need to get out the van My first ever job in construction I got yelled at a lot by the super for choking up on my hammer when framing. I wish I had shown up on the jobsite with this. Don‚Äôt forget your safety glasses on that one. Leverage 19oz Hammer! Swings like a 53oz!!! What a beautiful piece of art! Everything checks out, no reason for concern. Continue work. Lol, he‚Äôll that should become the hammer of shame!   Anyone who fucks up with a hammer shall be punished with it! Needs a longer handle I worked with a Russian carpenter who makes his own custom handles. Not quite this long but close. He wasn\\'t the tallest guy so it helped him out. Should‚Äôve used a longer handle I think he should be perfectly grateful! I would post it on r/specialtytools As the saying goes,   ‚ÄúThe bigger the hammer, the bigger the job.‚Äù I had a random shower thought the other day and I want to act on it. 3 masonry hammers welded together with a axe handle attached. Please tell me you don\\'t work high rise.... There is no way in hell any of the foreman for the company I work for would allow anything but steel handles up top. Leverage level 5000% Extendo Haha side by side, to split block like Zeus would who needs hickory when pine is so much lighter? ultra lite toolbox is the wave of the future. The leverage on this thing is gratifying. I think thats a stick overlapping/sitting on top of an unbroken hammer. Just slap a  ‚ÄúStilletto‚Äù logo on it and you‚Äôll sell one to every wanna be bad ass ..... The only problem is, he‚Äôs not righteous enough to pick it up. can i buy it? If I had a hammer  I\\'d hammer in the morning   I\\'d hammer in the evening  All over this land Hey man, I feel your pain. My unique problem has been that big sites deciding not to operate has put all of the smaller domestic jobs at the front of the line. Which is putting like 25 dudes on my sites that would usually have me and my two guys on. My worksites are getting busier not quieter, Australia is going alright atm but I am perplexed at the moment. I was working on a project that was pretty critical. I\\'ve been pulled to a stupid one so a subcontractor can get in that space  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'m going to work today yet & I\\'m supposed to leave in 45 minutes. I really don\\'t know what to do. I won\\'t lose the job if I stay home, but I just came off a long winter lay off. Glad to see some people actually share this sentiment. Sometimes you gotta say fuck it. My boss said if I don‚Äôt wanna work because of coronavirus can go work at Burger King. I‚Äôm in Chicago doing completely non essential demo work on a hotel that is being renovated. 10 of us wearing rubber gloves and going through at least 10 N95 masks a day. It‚Äôs honestly sickening that we are still working and wasting resources that could go to protect the people saving lives. I truly hope that after all this, people actually remember the companies that did absolutely nothing to help. Told our owner, and my dad (my operator) on our pipe crew that I\\'ll be staying home until the spread is more contained. They started on the line of \"it\\'s one of the safer jobs as far as that goes, what will you do for money, and it\\'s basically you quitting so you won\\'t get unemployment\" I told then that my health, my families, crews, and their health is more important to me than some people more wealthy than them that want houses built. They didn\\'t quite understand where I was coming from, but definitely respect it. Remember that\\'s it\\'s up to you to decide when it\\'s safe enough to work (equipment, and conditions). Be safe or there guys. The comeback is always stronger than the setback. Unless we are building a hospital, a clinic, or re-furbishing an existing factory/plant so that ventilators and other essential PPE can be produced, nothing we do is essential. [deleted] smart, id work for you, my wife is a nurse. ‚ÄúHospitals would be too overwhelmed to deal with our injured asses‚Äù  This is what I keep telling people who, now that they are stuck at home with plenty of free time, think it‚Äôs a good time to take up hiking and think a 4/5 difficulty 8 mile trail is a good starting point.   When they go out and snap an ankle or fall down a hill, it will be my volunteer search and rescue team going out, getting exposed and risking our own injuries, and you take up a hospital bed because you watched Bear Grylls one too many times. I work for a large commercial GC and out of 166 projects across the country, only 7 have been shut down so far. There is no way we have that many essential projects. Unfortunately, we can\\'t shut down jobs even if we wanted to since we are bound by a contract. Unless the government or the project owners decide to shut down the jobs, then we are on the hook for liquidated damages if we stop work, and the owner\\'s don\\'t want to pay for our extended general conditions so it doesn\\'t seem like they are going to tell us to stop any time soon. Absolutely. The super on our job told us to say 6\\' apart. We\\'re standing 12\\' sheets of drywall. There is no way we can stay 1\\' apart, much less 6. It would be one thing if it was actually an essential project (hospital etc), I understand. But even if the project finished tommorow, office workers wouldn\\'t be able to occupy it anyway since they\\'re non essential.  This will go down as one of the biggest failure of gov\\'ts and employers across the world to protect their people. Most are more worried about the economy. The first couple weeks unlocking the gates and going into work during the Pandemic have been tough. Signs everywhere telling you to stay home. People everywhere watching you from windows as you go about your day as if you‚Äôre the walking dead.    I‚Äôve succumb to my fate whatever it be. My only hope is that I don‚Äôt cause illness to my wife or infant son. I do wish the Health Ministries would shut us down. But the longer this drags on the less likely I see that happening.     Keep your social distance they say this will keep the virus at bay. This is unpopular? My company already sent all our masks to the hospital. Imagine working on a project for 3.5 years.  Finally you\\'re about to finish. All the paperwork, finishes and cleaning is done. You\\'re ready for inspections.  If all goes smoothly, you\\'re due for great bonuses.  Then this shit hits the fan. All inspections are cancelled and your ass is furloughed until further notice. Southeast (greater Atlanta area) and home builders are still going strong.  We build decks and fences for some of the largest nationwide builders.  We had so much rain in Jan, Feb. that everything is behind schedule.  So they are making up for it now that the weather is dry(ish).  We are also seeing an increase in renovation projects because people are home and want to get their ugly deck replaced.  I just stand 10-15\\' away from the homeowner as they explain what they want done to the deck or fence.  We are fortunate that we build decks and fences and only have 3-4 guys per crew, and they are following the recommended guidelines.  Our supplier has closed their showroom, so we can\\'t just show up and pick up material.  We have to call it in ahead of time and they can load it without contact.  Are decks and fences essential, no.  But, if the builder can\\'t finish his build-out, then it doesn\\'t pass inspection, doesn\\'t provide shelter for the new owner.  If the virus infection rate doesn\\'t peak soon, I expect we will be shut down.  But until then we are being as safe as possible. I\\'m in a low infection state and our dumbfuck GC pulled a crew from Colorado and a crew from Washington to our site.  How fucking retarded is that?  Of course, the owner and architect don\\'t live here, so why the fuck would they care? If I didn\\'t hate the two of them already, I sure do now. I\\'ve had the same thought.  I\\'m building a carwash in a town in Texas... About 3 hours from home.  I\\'d just kind of rather be home.  Staying in hotels, having to eat out, and go get supplies puts me around so many more people.  I\\'d rather put everything on pause and wait it out. The owners of our company sent out a fucking joke of a video saying that we will stay strong and get through this. They proceed to tell us to make sure to wear ppe like safety glasses and high vis.   Also stay 6 ft apart from your nearest teammate. Most od the business is concrete, good luck follwing that rule What if I told you that a few weeks off isn‚Äôt going to be worth a pinch of shit. But a few *months*, or SEVERAL months is the answer. How would you feel then? Because I‚Äôm sorry to say but that‚Äôs the reality mate and you very well might not get the choice in a few weeks. 100%  Never mind that we can‚Äôt even get the PPE we need to do our jobs...  And yes, the project I‚Äôm on could wait. I don‚Äôt see how ALL construction has been deemed essential. I cannot upvote this hard enough.  You have no idea how correct you are about receiving care when you are injured, and the resources it takes up.  Let me illustrate a real-life example.  I currently have bilateral inguinal hernias, and they are uncomfortable.  I\\'m a healthcare PROVIDER, I work in surgery, and even I cannot get a slot to have them repaired.  I\\'m stuck waiting until after COVID passes.  Literally all of our resources are being allocated towards COVID, as they should be.  Will I be uncomfortable waiting, yes.  Will I survive?  Yes, I\\'ll be fine, it\\'ll just be annoying.  We aren\\'t even doing surgery for slow-going cancer right now...  #stayhomesavelives isn\\'t just a platitude, it\\'s necessary as a society for the survival of many of our most vulnerable members.  Your generosity in donating PPE goes further than you can even imagine.  That PPE allows providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, cleaning crews, and even some volunteers, to give everything they have towards fighting COVID.  It literally saves lives, and it goes without saying that every life is so, so, valuable. This is an interesting conversation. I have been thinking about this a lot lately. The company I work for is on the smaller side. So it‚Äôs basically a couple guys in a truck. We work outside all the time. We don‚Äôt really interact with anyone besides ourselves and wherever we stop for lunch. So I think for the most part we are ok. But then I had to stop at Home Depot for a box of screws. And I was completely floored at how many people were in there just wandering around. That‚Äôs where I am having issues. But at the end of it, we build decks. This isn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and we should be home. My exact thought. As someone who does insulation and knowing my company is shut down right now, I truly believe all of our PPE which include nitrile gloves and n95 face masks should all be given to medical staff. Just a reminder that some politicians get a good percentage of campaign contributions from contractors. These people aren‚Äôt going to be out their fucking money. Fuck that. Get the fuck out there and work you expendable fucking nothings. This is who we are to them. Could you imagine if just one of us had the power to turn it right back on em? Until then my family doesn‚Äôt eat unless I hit my 40 hours and get my shit squared away. Fuck our labor and loyalty, fuck our health, and the fuck the health of our family. I‚Äôm a Site Manager, currently building 180 open market houses and a load of council houses. We closed our site last week, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to carry on.  I struggle to get the guys to wash their hands and respect the toilets as it is - let alone making them work 2m apart and wash hands every 10 mins....  The amount of people that visit the site every day, makes it even more unsafe!   Good luck to you! > I just wanna get this over with and stay the fuck at home for three weeks and then go back and take my chances then.   Just want to clarify that the entire point of the quarantine is not to ‚Äúget this over with‚Äù by speeding things up. In fact, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. The point of the quarantine is to draw things out and make the pandemic last longer so that the medical system isn‚Äôt overwhelmed all at once; to allow more supplies to be produced/distributed, more coordinated planning to take place. Staying home for three weeks is not some magic panacea that makes the issue go away. There is no waiting this out, unless you‚Äôre talking about shutting things down until this time next year when, if we‚Äôre lucky, we will finally have a vaccine developed. Life will have to return to some semblance of normal well before this truly passes. The fact is most Americans will eventually get coronavirus and most will not even suffer any ill effects. That‚Äôs not to say your concerns aren‚Äôt justified and your site shouldn‚Äôt down. But frankly I‚Äôm just tired of seeing social media posts to the effect of ‚ÄúI feel like a kindergartner who keeps loosing more recess time bc one or two kids can‚Äôt follow directions‚Äù That‚Äôs not how any of this works Project engineer/superintendent for a big GC here. I 100% agree with you but my company has made it clear that unless a client directs us to shut a project down, it stays open. Like the client on my project hasn\\'t even floated the idea of shutting down temporarily even though my state was one of the first to have a shelter in place order. Kind of sucks because this customer claims to be \"people friendly\" but yet they don\\'t seem to give a shit about the well-being of the blue-collar, construction workers building their new, precious cafe. I drive a forklift for a home builder in SoCal working for a nationwide developer.   Business as usual here except all the bosses are talking a big social distancing game but in reality ignoring everything.  Pouring concrete for the next phase on Friday,  dropping lumber on Monday and back at it.   I have told others to stay away from me. If you need me call me.  If you try and flag me down I will drive right by.   I\\'m fine going to work,  or staying home.  I just pray we dont, as a business and a trade,  have many accidents wasting valuable resourses at the hospitals. Gst as many of your co-workers as you can to stop going in on the same day I\\'m in the same boat, myself. I work for a contractor. I mentioned my worries to my boss about wanting to isolate and stay home for fear of getting everyone else in my house sick. But I do need money. So as for now and the foreseeable future me and the rest of the crew are working alone on solo jobs for my boss on empty rentals or flip houses. I still dont k ow if I should be but I feel it\\'s better than working in our usual crews Drag up over concerns for your health. At the next safety meeting, stand up, say so, say the company isn\\'t adequately addressing our health and safety, and walk the fuck out. You\\'ll probably qualify for UE. No I‚Äôm desperate for work rn. My government has denied me all access to support so I have no choice but to work. I\\'m really hoping that one of the older Journeyman on site organizes a walkout in the next couple weeks if it gets worse and worse and they dont shut our site down I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I‚Äôm a field superintendent and I don‚Äôt want to call my subs and ask them to work. Then the office cock suckers call and get on my case. They are sitting at home on the couch complaining that we don‚Äôt want to work. The only way they will make money is if we are working. Heck one of them asked me if I would go run a job out of state starting this month. Fuck that. I love this post. Thanks for sharing. It‚Äôs comforting knowing other people feel the same. Construction can wait. IMHO if the entire construction industry stopped for the quarantine, especially with the amount of workers that have been employed by it in the recent boom, it will be the last industry to come back online.   The overwhelming amount of unemployment claims is one item, but when the industry actually can restart, it will be slow. This will cause only the experienced workers to be brought back at first and not even all of them. Most of the older workers and a lot of the mid level will move out of the industry for something more ‚Äústable‚Äù. The apprenticeships will dry up as well. Then we will be stuck with more unskilled tradesmen than experienced ones. It will domino and postpone the next 10+ years of projects. Basically it will cripple the industry and result in decades of poorer quality projects.   I understand and your concern and am right there with you. My other major concern is the industry as a whole never really recovering. We still are feeling the shockwaves from the 2008 market collapse and there were large projects still being completed during that timeframe. A complete stop will crush us all.   One item a lot of people fail to see is that if the project cannot get funded, it won‚Äôt proceed. If projects that are currently funded go belly up, it will leave husks of incomplete buildings dotting the skyline. The amount of money and labor needed to recondition or retrofit one of these projects is insurmountable and likely will cause large scale demolitions and multiple, I mean multiple lawsuits, as in a metric fuck ton of lawsuits being filed and undermining the foundation of the industry.   Many projects will require cash in hand for the entire project up front. That will scare many to not even begin.   I‚Äôm talking about the construction industry going dark for a decade, at least. But that‚Äôs just my lowly opinion. I hope to hell im wrong. I was talking to my former VP yesterday who does work all over the US. His southern projects are still going strong. Most people are working. Midwest is pretty well shut down. So far $80 million in work in process and no CV-19.  EDIT: I was surprised that jobs were still going, but there are a lot of states without mandatory quarantine. I have nothing else to say here except- I like you, man. You‚Äôre a good dude and you make sense. Our govorner had all major contractors in the state do an inventory of PPE. Almost all companies have halted major upcoming projects and finished the ones they had going on and then stopped the majority of non essential projects. The smaller home contractors are ignoring the SIP order and continuing operations. The smaller contractors are the ones who don\\'t have safety training, PPE, or first aid on site. So that\\'s cool. We are not disposable. Well said I stopped going on my own it was messing with my head too much   Some of our jobs gathered all the dust mask to give to first responders We are the only assholes still working at full manpower levels. 700 men in a site and minimal hygiene resources. The GC and ownership can kiss my ass. Commercial HVAC foreman in Atlanta .  Nervous as hell , I am running a job with over 300 plus swinging hammers on site. We all share 25 shiters no paper no soap or water.   As for hand sanitizer or cleaning supply‚Äôs I am not so sure that these things even exist.    The higher ups on the job have all gone to teleworking and all job meetings including stretch and flex and safety meetings have been canceled.   When questioned when are we shutting down the simple answer is not until some one on site tests positive.  I personally don‚Äôt want to be here anymore but I have a responsibility to my team who have decided to work until we can‚Äôt.  Please stay safe out there brothers and sisters, My company put out a notice that said that if anyone on a project had symptoms of flu or coronavirus, that job would shut down.  Someone on the GC team for my job just got quarantined last night with fever and cough and guess what job site is still open!  Next safety manager who tells me I\\'m putting people at risk by leaving an extension cord on the ground is gonna get a fucking earful Boston shut down all jobsites per order of the mayor (or governor). Unfortunately it takes something like that for those with the deepest pockets to put people over profits. This reminds me of the time I went to an outdoor concert with my wife and she was like EW THESEOUTHOUSES ARE DISGUSTING and I\\'m like what? They\\'re the cleanest I\\'ve ever seen. Most of them dont even have shit on the seat next to muddy footprints I work for a D/B firm. Architects, engineers and others are working from home. Meanwhile, I\\'m about 1,000 miles from home. Job must be completed on time! All construction sites. They treat us like animals I\\'m a Super for a large GC (project is not in NYC or SF) and we are still open.     We are following CDC guidelines, have double cleaning of all areas (including adding a disinfectant fogging of all common areas inc honey pots), keeping track of anybody who calls in, have told people if they want to stay home for whatever reason they can, and have canceled all in person meetings except the morning huddle.  People underestimate how many people are pay-check to pay-check. Our guys are happy to have the option to work and not dig into savings.     We are making sure we are tracking who is out sick for whatever reason. If it jumps, we will shut down. We already shutdown one day and fogged the building when we had our first \\'maybe\\' since testing is so hard to get.    All our non field staff are def working from home however! Should have stayed a PM!    Stay safe everyone! Currently a superintendent for a GC, I tell people all the time that I cant build from home. Trades and construction workers are keeping America Afloat right now My GM emailed me last night and wanted a two week look ahead. I called him and asked him what was going on because I‚Äôve already sent him one. He said they are considering cutting the workforce down to only essential people till this blows over. Till then we are running at 100% Where I work they implemented a liberal leave policy meaning no penalties besides not getting paid for missing work. Today they announced since production is low we can start working seven twelves to make up for production. Union? Well, when you gotta go.... Home remodeler here in the NW. We are all working and hope to keep working so we can keep paying our bills. We are asking clients if they want us there or not. We have work booked out until late fall, but we‚Äôve put one off indefinitely due to the poor health of the owner. Everyone here is healthy and so are their families, so we will keep going. It‚Äôs good to have something to do rather than stay home, and well be forced to work on your own house.... As remodelers, we normally use the client‚Äôs bathroom or in some cases a porta potty, but it‚Äôs just for us, so it‚Äôs not nasty. Thankfully the porta potty crew is still working and willing to keep the toilets clean. No complaints. Everyone wants to continue working. Bills to pay. Kids are all home though. One guy‚Äôs wife does tattoo make up for a living, she‚Äôs still working, so I guess tattoos must still go on.... It‚Äôs ok....the grunts will keep this planet ticking over. Calling all pen pushers...can you push a wheel barrow? I once seen the shit piled OVER the seat of a shitter because the jobsite didnt want to pay the bill. Didnt get cleaned until starbucks complained when we used thier bathrooms. Boston shut down all construction for 2 weeks. Others should follow as most of it is commercial and indoors. Don‚Äôt you union guys have things in place for this? I am fortunate to be a simple handyman. My regulars are still calling and we are all on board with sanitation protocols. If a family member is sick i do not work there. It is a B&G job I‚Äôm just as shocked as you That\\'s pretty much construction everywhere that its not shut down.  We\\'re still working, but a lot of jobs have been shit down. Same story in the UK, construction is always the last worry for people Few of our sites shut down already I heard Friday all construction is shut down is that true? Nary a fuck giv‚Äôn, mate Service electrician here. Honestly I‚Äôm just glad my company gave me the choice to stay home or work if I wanted to. I don‚Äôt expect them to keep paying while I stay home but a lot of people in other fields (bartenders, waiters, etc) didn‚Äôt have a choice. They‚Äôre just out of a job. Doing my best to practice good pandemic hygiene, keeping my distance from customers but I‚Äôm still crawling around in someone‚Äôs attic like any other Wednesday so... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è In Sweden we get paid if we are sick and they say that you should stay at home if you get ANY symptoms. So there is no reason to go work if you don\\'t feel 100%, no doctors note is required.  Usually you get no money on the first Day and then you get 80% of your salary, after 5 days you need a note from the doctor saying that you aren\\'t well but the government changed the law to keep the sickos at home. Still only get 80% though i think. Under the law the employer must provide a safe work environment. This is impossible during a viral pandemic. Anything short of sending everyone home with a clean layoff / furlough = gross negligence.  NYC just ordered a general quarantine - no gatherings of more than 5 people. Building a building is not an essential service. Take it while you can get it. Should be a lot more worried about what‚Äôs happened to the market and the effect that‚Äôll have on jobs for months and months to come. That being said FM clauses should cover pretty much any shut downs right now. Your local day labor place can get you started. There is no shame in starting as a laborer; I did. If you just do your job, you will be hanging around the other trades all the time. If you have experience, or just a willingness to learn, it will show. I went from laborer to laborer foreman to apprentice carpenter to journeyman carpenter in a few years. Ya it took me 6 months to land my first electrical gig and I love the company and career choice I made.  The only regret I have is not starting as a senior in HS instead of racking up college debt that never materialized into a quality career path, thanks business management I\\'ll hire you as long as you show up on time and want to learn. Just know that pay is based on experience. I have some green kids come in saying they heard you can make such and such per hour in this trade and that\\'s what they want. It doesn\\'t work that way. Apprenticeship! Honestly though, boots, hard hat and safety glasses (own tools if you have any) drive around looking for job sites, go to the office and ask, they appreciate it more [deleted] Just lie about your experience. Hey, if they fire you after a day at least you got that sweet experience! Find a trade that\\'s hiring. I started as an Electrician\\'s Helper. The pay is low but ai knew that going in. What Trade do you want to do? If you got nothing to do grab a broom I felt this in my soul I mean you can also go to your community college and get a welding cert or try to join a union Just a thought but I got my first job in construction this summer, while I was looking I started volunteering with habitat for humanity building houses. Good experience and volunteering history and gets you used to the work so you\\'re pretty much ready to go once you land a job. I ended up getting hired as a demolitions laborer so being in shape for it made a huge difference Seriously, showing up, hustling, taking initiative and accountability with a good attitude- and you will move up quickly Or you look for the shittiest company that is desperate and you work there and let them torture you . At least that\\'s what I did Where do you live? Maybe I can use a guy. Look up local apprenticeship programs Don\\'t give up. I started as a laborer, then apprentice, and so on. Currently a PM and doing alright. Whatever your trade is, learn every inch of it. Only way to do it is to just do it. It takes time to learn a trade, let alone many trades. You‚Äôre gonna have to sweep a lot of floors, or pick up after other tradesmen to learn. Too many kids give up, so not many journeyman are willing to teach, until you prove you‚Äôre not a shitbag. Or join the union and you can chose to be a shit bag or a pro. But these days it‚Äôs really hard to get in if you‚Äôre a shitbag. Unless you know someone. Anyway, I know the struggle. Been in construction my whole life. Work your ass off and have a good attitude every day and it will pay off. Even if your on a shit crew. Stay consistent and show up on time. If you hate your crew but you learned some skills, you can shop around for a better crew. Gonna start off at the bottom again, but hard work pays off. Speaking of, if your in nyc, and want to learn metalwork, hit me up.    If, as you say, you want to be an electrician, get in the fucking union. Best training, and you get paid to learn. You will eat shit for a couple years, but if you don‚Äôt wash out, you‚Äôll be set for life, and certified. You can always go solo after. IBEW is a legit union for the most part, and you can travel and work anywhere. Good gig. I did it for a minute and have some buddies in IBEW. It‚Äôs a good trade in general. You‚Äôre going to have to take a job grunting. Carrying shit crawling in places. Once you get that job talk to the guys say hey do you need anything wave me over I‚Äôll help you hold something I‚Äôll help you move something. I‚Äôve been on many job sites where helpers were pulled in because when someone was needed at that moment one of the journeyman said that dude over there is been helping me.  If you‚Äôre trying to get on with a small company go to their website and learn about the jobs they do learn about the products they use and talk to them in their own language.  Tell them you really envy the way they built their business, you want to work for a company like theirs. Everybody loves to hear about their own accomplishments.  things like that make you stand out.  I recommend reading the book ‚Äúhow to Win friends and influence people‚Äù as well It is a very old book but it stands the test of time it explains how to communicate with people in a way that they appreciate. Good luck All you have to do is this:  Worker: I\\'ll show up 5 days a week and work 8 hours a day....  Employer: ....  Worker: ...  Employer: You\\'re hired. You start immediately experience doesn\\'t even matter here, they are happy enough if some people want to work, construction is very underrated in my country, due small salary propably. I hate it. Just do like me and have a stepdad whose cousin owns a contracting business hire you. I was REALLY lucky to get my labouring job. My brother knows my boss and was able to call in a couple of favours otherwise there\\'s no way I would of gotten it. Sometimes you just need a bit of luck. Do you know anyone who could pull any strings for you? For anyone that was asking I live in Tucson Arizona. If that is the case you are doing it wrong. Oh ok thanks for reminding me of what I‚Äôve done. 25 year journeyman carpenter here in Colorado. Go to a temp agency man, gets your foot in the door.  I had same problem last year and now a days when I quit/get fired I usually land a new construction job within 48 hrs. Shits crazy, I couldn\\'t get a call back last year to now company\\'s fighting over me.       I hope it goes well for you! Try getting *out* of construction.  I worked 15 years either solo or running small crews. Decided that I should try and get off the tools before my body collapses on me.  I\\'m old enough to understand my habits well enough to know I need structured learning. So I go to a local college for their \"Construction Tech\" open house. Sit through the spiel, break off with the group that seems geared towards the most barebones, entry level coursework. Still felt at sea. Like they were starting two levels above what I wanted or needed to learn.  I stayed behind to ask two potential instructors where to start. They kept asking me what my construction office experience was. Maybe I had an internship or student experience. I said, no, I\\'ve worked in construction, on jobs, in my trade, for 15 years. I couldn\\'t make them understand. It didn\\'t feel like it counted for anything. They seemed to think (maybe rightly so) that everyone looking to apply was already an estimator, PM, superintendent, etc.  So now I\\'m just quietly sitting at home, working on computer skills in my spare time with no clear path. It is intensely frustrating.  Not sure where this started, but it became me venting/ranting. I\\'m one of very few of my friends who went into a trade and not many people get where I\\'m coming from.  I guess I should say, track your hours and experience once you get started, and keep learning, don\\'t stagnate. Where I live there\\'s a terrible shortage of labor. The new generation doesnt want to work. Where are you located? Los Angeles plumbers union starts off $17.30 no experience. Just have to score high on a test or know somebody. Your considered a pre-apprentice. If you decided that, that‚Äôs the career path you want to take, you start the school. $21.10 first year apprentice. Journeyman tops out at $46 I believe. If your a welder/plumber it‚Äôs a few bucks more per hour. Truest thing I‚Äôve ever read. If you can\\'t find a job in construction you must be retarded. I wish I could find someone who‚Äôs just entering the field!  I would love to hire someone who just loves the trades but no experience and I can‚Äôt freaking find anyone.   Then when I find someone who knows the difference between a hammer and a drill they think they‚Äôre worth $30 an hour.   Is finding people just all word of mouth or what? Thank God the guy in sweat pants and tennis shoes has his vest and hardhat now My company gave me orange, yellow, and pink hi-vis t-shirts  the pink ones look the best imo so I\\'m not sure if I would mind. My last boss would put pink princess duct tape on tool handles to discourage theives One site I worked on had a phase of giving out a very pink vest for when anyone did something stupid. I took great joy in seeing a very large Scottish man wear it. I don‚Äôt even remember what he did to get to wear it. Sadly the higher ups didn‚Äôt think it was a positive thing since it singled out the stupid. But if you was less stupid to avoid the pink that‚Äôs nothing but good for me. Stupid = unsafe The vest of shame This should honestly be a thing. My operator ‚Äúforgot‚Äù his boots, vest and hard hat last week. Showed up in Jordan‚Äôs and a t shirt and man that pissed me off. Of course he can still operate like that as long as he‚Äôs got glasses but I felt like he did that just because not having ppe meant he didn‚Äôt have to get outta the machine to help that day We tried that and people wouldn\\'t give them back afterwards so... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Yup, I\\'ve had pink hard hats in the trailer for this exact thing. Public shaming at it\\'s finest. [https://www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/intro\\\\_osha/7\\\\_employee\\\\_ppe.pdf](https://www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/intro_osha/7_employee_ppe.pdf)  \"Employers must provide and pay for PERSONAL Protective Equipment.\"  Let\\'s research into whether misogynistic inferred attributes of employer provided PPE, constitutes harassment, shall we? su noiJ...

Reminds me of the time I went for a walk and I came back to find the local werewolf ate my mom. I was just walking along my nice street minding my bidnis when apparently a warewolf jumped out and gobbled her up. Turns out the warewolf was not real. My mom ran away with a lesbian olive oil salesman and I wait for her to return every night with some vinegar and some crusty bread. Damn heartbreaking. I had a mason that used to bring his dog to work every day.   Spencer.  Spencer was no slouch though- used to carry the drop cords back to the connex every day.   Even had his own HiVis vest, shoes, and goggles.   No one didn\\'t like Spencer. I\\'ll take him he\\'s hired  will teach to roll out the tools every morning üåÑ Some of my favorite coworkers are pretty useless. But easy to be around, you know. If I have to be there, give me somebody that makes the time go by, any day. You ask your boss to send a good guy and instead get a good boy Reminds me of the time a well known friendly street dog got bit by a rattle snake and went and laid down by a framed wall. Nobody wanted to approach the dog so I had to call animal control. I waited around for them to show up 10-15 minutes. The tech looked over the dog real quick and said ‚Äú poor girl. I‚Äôm surprised she is still alive. She definitely won‚Äôt make it back to the shelter.‚Äù  I then watched him drag this heavy dog by its neck with the stick thing that they used. He said she was too weak to walk on her own.  It was damn heartbreaking watching an otherwise happy street dog quickly approaching death without anyone able to comfort her through all the pain. WONDER FOR MORALE ‚ù§Ô∏è Your new supervisor looks supportive! I see your useless employee and I raise you a useless safety manager [safety manager](https://imgur.com/a/DpM8Quh) Future foreman right there Production numbers definitely went down. He may not do much but then again he won\\'t break much either, so he may still be more productive than the next guy.

Don‚Äôt you dare call him useless again üò§, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs there for emotional support :) \"Hey boss the new roofer\\'s here!\" where‚Äôs his vest? surely that‚Äôs a health and safety issue Can people not tell a joke anymore You guys need to quit with this ‚Äú*possibly having time off ‚Äî maybe even *paid* time off ‚Äî to enjoy your lives because of the global pandemic*‚Äù dream.  It will never happen.  Jefe wants everyone else back to work by Easter now.  Guess what that means?  Your working Easter too ya fuck. I like how the new construction I‚Äôm working on is considered essential... The cops are like non existent in NJ, theyre all busy with other shit. Ive cut my hour and 40 commute home down to 50 mins. Theres 0 traffic, and with 0 cops i can do 95 the whole way home. We haven\\'t hit the \"aren\\'t allowed to leave the house\" point yet, but they have ordered the shutdown of \"non-essential services\". And I\\'m just kind of chuckling that this garage that I\\'m building at a cottage is \"essential\". I thought of it more as a hall pass from the teacher so when you get caught going to the bathroom in school. Idaho was just locked down, but we‚Äôre still going to work. What‚Äôs up with these papers?? Do we need papers? My brother and I do metal work and it‚Äôs only us in our shop. All the customer work is done by email we barely meet them anyway so we‚Äôll just keep goin and try not to die I guess I\\'m going to post this on the main page as well but I wrote this to my superiors because we sometimes to stupid paperwork when we should really be looking out for the guys putting work in place in \"Essential\" Jobsites:     Most employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around...   Since a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum:   1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment) 2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces  3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.) 4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other. 5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. 6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)  I assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.  The first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.    To conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.    This is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. Got mine yesterday. Laminated card and everything! We are ‚Äúessential‚Äù yet ‚ÄúExpendable ‚Äú. The only essential part is turning over the finish product so that the owner can start making money. Ayy just got mine as well. I\\'m an assistant foreman In the electrical field. No excuse here.. we build hospitals. But we‚Äôre adjacent to the largest hospital in the northern part of the state. HR says we won‚Äôt get any help Unless we get sick and we‚Äôd be separated if we make the personal choice to not show up and quarantine. :-/ Apparently putting commercial roofs on Amazon warehouses is essential... Quit the bullshit, why would police care what an employer says?       Nowhere are letters essential from travel, please stop posting this kind of stuff. I laughed way too hard at this. We\\'re not under martial law. They can\\'t enforce this on individuals walking the street.    That being said, without regular people walking around, I have never noticed how many homeless and junkies there are actually just roaming around. Shit\\'s surreal. Wait wait wait paper work??? I didnt get a single sheet of shit. All this pandemic is showing me is my company doesnt give a fuck about me.... Wait, so martial law? Im going to vent.  State went on lock down. I was deemed essential.  Building a staircase for a homeowner\\'s second home doesn\\'t seem essential to me.   So my question is what is essential and Socially Responsible? [deleted] Skill Tradesmen and women are expendable apparently..I would suggest ‚Äòcalling in sick‚Äô if you are working with a large crew I think you mean a *full face-shield is important when disc grinding.* Electrician here. Reasons like your post are why our company is zero tolerance when it comes to certain PPE. Safety Glasses, Gloves, and Boots at all times regardless of the task. Hard Hat and High vis is optional depending on the generals requirement on the jobsite. Man, That would have really hurt going in to skin if it missed the glasses (not mentioning the total eye destruction if it hit dead on) I have been using those exact 3m glasses.   Good to see they are built for the job. My brother one time used the wrong cutting wheel to grind something down real quick and  it ended up hitting him in his lower ab and causing a deep gash before he even realized the disc had broken. Better go play lottery you got super lucky with that one , today could have been the day you lost an eye What is the other half imbedded in? (Don\\'t have great resolution on the phone...sorry.) I really don\\'t think this picture is real. There are just a few things that don\\'t add up. I don\\'t think a little grinder spins fast enough for this sort of carnage, I\\'ve had an incident with a 9\"grinder that left me shaken but no damage was done to anything in the vicinity. Also, why did it hit his glasses horizontally but the drywall vertically? I\\'m not sure there are too many situations in an auto body shop that would cause you to have to tilt your head 90 degrees while there still being enough room for the wheel to fly with so much force. If it is real I think there were probably a few mistakes made prior to the incident. That wheel was already broken before turning on the grinder. He also would have had shit flying in his face since BOTH of his eyes were apparently in line with the wheel.   I\\'m a proponent of PPE but lying isn\\'t helping anyone. Glad you‚Äôre alright man that could‚Äôve been bad!!! Oof.  Remember lads, protection is important. This illustrates the point of PPE, however these photos are fake as fuck. Holy sh!t!! What is that piece a part of ? A table saw?? When i was young, i remember using the grinder to get paint and rust off from poles(square hollow tubes used for signs) and a chunk of the blade flung at me, small chunk, rebounded from my upper cheek and embedded into the glassess on the inside lens.... Dam one of these broke apart and hit me right in the neck once, didnt cut me or anything but it was sure as hell a scary experience. I had on a face shield at that. Damn!   wet grinder disks? OK, I am never using a grinder without glasses again. Thanks, man. Glad you did the same.  edit: Never using a grinder without glasses and a face shield as per comments. I can\\'t believe how dumb and risky  I have done shit before. Protective eyewear is important *when using a Metabo Seen my buddy take a disc from his forehead down almost to his chin. Was only centimetres from his eye. If it had been 3 or 4 cm to the left he‚Äôd of lost his eye.   Where I work, it‚Äôs faceshield and glasses or full face respirator when grinding, depending on the task and location. In confined spaces it‚Äôs full face respirator NO MATTER WHAT you‚Äôre doing. Bro you‚Äôre really lucky it didn‚Äôt hit you lower or higher. FAKE, but I always wear eye protection How did this happen? And how to avoid it?  I\\'m a DIYer and im gonna be using an angle grinder for the first time this coming weekend.. Is this bullshit? Everytime one grinder blade cracks on me it just stays there I really wish they would just stop making these discs. Spend a few extra bucks and get a diamond blade. Not being an idiot with a zip disc is also important. Congrats on your first small erection, hopefully many more to come. I\\'m sure in no time you\\'ll move on to large erections. Erected. Hehe My first paycheck as a steel erector was hilarious. Having experience with meta buildings the biggest advice I can give you is to check the anchor bolt dimensions and layout throughout the concrete process. This will save you so much time and heartache  By the way I own a steel construction company and we are proud of our erections! My feet are cold just looking at this. Congrats! You‚Äôll be proud when you sit back and look at the finished product. Word of advice, don‚Äôt let the stress get to you. Stop at a reasonable hour and disconnect. There is nothing in construction that cannot be fixed, except the well-being of your workers. Safety first. üôÇüëç How much more expensive is this than a wood frame? Is that a re-engineered structure?  If so, what brand?  Congrats either way.  To those saying it\\'s cold there, this guys the PM so he\\'s most likely not the guy in the field anyway. Keep it up mate It‚Äôs ok man, it was cold af outside Great work!   Good luck! Looks good!    Where are you working out of? Looks good. Tell them to install the rod braces or put temp cables-before any wind storms hit .. The steel isn\\'t the only thing here being erected ;-) Is this what it meant by ‚Äústeel elections‚Äù in my construction safety book??? Watch it rise before your eyes! ‚ÄúHave you got an erection yet?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm hoping to get one for Christmas.‚Äù Did anyone tell you its leaning to the left? :-( As long as the columns are fully bolted down and fully connected to the roof framing, it will probably be okay, but if not... MBMA temporary bracing for longitudinal wind? When a job goes well, I get erected too. Congrats! I‚Äôm about to turn 19 hoping to be a PM in a couple years. No temporary bracing to the steel? Shame, what‚Äôs a real ladder if they‚Äôre not there to support you. Step ladder? Just use a bucket /r/ComedyCemetery This might be the pinnacle of dad jokes. Get back to work, dad This ladder is mandatory in my cabinet install truck. Heeey, theres my step-child! Been lookin everywhere for it. Jay London! Last i heard he was in a 12 step program \"You\\'re not my real ladder!!!\"   I never met my real ladder, but my step later raised me. But, did it do a good job raising you? I worked for a company that was pretty safety-oriented after a couple of OSHA visits. I was trimming out a window and didn\\'t have my damn step-ladder on me that day. So I was on top of a bucket, and the thing just folded up on me. I hit the floor and really jacked my lower back up. It never would have been a better time for the boss-man to roll up on the site. He literally walked into the room right when I fell and was rolling around on the floor groaning. He had the funniest southern accent, too. So I\\'m on the floor and this guy is just standing over me saying, \"You see, xlitawit? That\\'s why we don\\'t stand on buckets.\" Yea what the fuck is with this? There‚Äôs less people at walmart than home depot it seems. [deleted] While I was waiting on my order to be loaded, I saw at least a third of the people walk out with NOTHING AT ALL. Another third had a small random item like a houseplant, garden hose, lightbulb, etc.   They NEED to accommodate the contractors a lil better so I don‚Äôt have to wait for Karen to buy a fern. Lmfao... Home Depot is the worst place to visit when it comes to coming in contact with people these days. If it‚Äôs past 12 I go to Lowe‚Äôs now Don\\'t be stupid.  Go Depot with a mask if you need supplies to do work.   Look at tools online if you wanna dick around I hear all these bitch ass celebrities preaching from their mansions...  I ain\\'t trying to wait in a bread lines for my rations... I work for a familiar distributor of products for heavy construction.  The amount of home owners coming in for random bullshit is infuriating.  I‚Äôm here so people can keep building hospitals and fixing bridges.  Not to teach you how to spruce up your fucking patio. They need to cancel the landscaping section and things would be a lot better Went to home Depot yesterday, twice, and it\\'s worse then Black Friday shopping. I think because of spring and being told you have to stay at home have been the cause of the uptick. Waited over 30 minutes to get in both times. During the week day, middle of the day, when Home Depot is usually a ghost town, the place is packed. Freaking crazy, all the workers yelling to keep your distance, stay out of my box, sir you can\\'t go in there, don\\'t touch that, like I am a little kid. Can\\'t wait till we get back to normal in a few years. I met an old dude just wandering the isles saying \"I\\'m not actually getting anything. I just needed out of the house.\"  I\\'ve never wanted to bash someone so badly I have started going to McCoys that is an extra 15min away just to escape the crowd. I work at the busiest Homedepot in Texas we have out line with a 2 hour wait to get in and even then people still come en masse I‚Äôve been making all my supply runs for jobs at 6am when Home Depot opens. I‚Äôm usually loaded into the sprinter and back in bed by 6:45.  Friday is the day Jackass Kemp lifted the ban on gyms, bowling alleys and other bullshit businesses.  At noon the wife comes out to the garage and says there‚Äôs no hot water. 15 year old water heater couldn‚Äôt just soldier on for another few months, it had to die NOW! Okay, I‚Äôve got most of my sweat fittings, just need a water heater and expansion tank. As I crest the hill, I think the parking lot doesn‚Äôt look too bad...Wrong! Fucking lot is filled the hell up. I mask up and hot foot it in to the water heaters only to be blocked by scores of idiots wandering around with a singular potted plant in their cart and the whole damn family to do it. I get to the water heaters and there is a guy asking an employee when he needs a new water heater, his is ‚Äúsix years old, is that ready to be replaced?‚Äù Employee sees me waiting for some help to get a 40 gallon on the cart. He tells the guy, ‚Äú I dont work in this department but, I think they last longer than that.‚Äù Finally he tells the guy he will get him somebody and helps me get mine on the cart. The guy was still there after I get my other sweat fittings, just standing around no cart or other items.  Municipalities that responded to the Spanish flu with the most serious measures bounced back economically two to ten times better than areas that treated it like a joke or hoax. I just dumped $800.00 there today, man it felt great to get out of the house. People can go to stores safely.   For fucks sake, people act like the mere act of breathing air outside of your house will contract covid-19.  My girlfriend is an RN and has worked directly with covid-19 positive patients for over a month now. She\\'s only been wearing N95 and P95 masks, no face shield or gown. She tested negative.  Wear a mask, your odds of getting it and transmitting it are reduced dramatically. Lowe\\'s hasn\\'t been as busy, been going there lately. Home Depot is my usual go to ... Guilty. Free time and a stimulus check got me a new shed, recessed lighting and a fresh coat of paint downstairs. Brought to you by your friendly neighborhood Home Depot.. Oh, and furlough. it\\'s cash me not catch me.. The builders merchants I use (for my DIY projects) is entirely closed, not even accepting online orders for delivery. I respect them doing this hugely for the safety of their staff.   Having said that I am going a bit mad. I also have three missing fence panels that I need to replace. The longer quarantine goes on the more things eventually become essential and it‚Äôs not like you can restrict those people coming to the store to just those people doing essential work. It‚Äôs a difficult problem. That has to be one of the most boring jobs you can have on site. I know he\\'s doing it for his kids at home. What is his job? Just to push the floor number? Good for them for being safe The elevators on my site are 1 person at a time unless everyone is wearing a mask. Probably for the best. It would only take one person in one of the higher traffic areas to get most of the site infected. He lives solo... lol On what, meeting a woman? Was working on a site where a guy had rigged one of these up... He was cutting some forms for concrete that need to be notched around some shit. His foreman saw it and went over there and cut the cord with a pair of side cutters.  Told his guy \"take the blade off, quit being an idiot, and fix the cord while I consider if I want to fire you or not.\" You\\'d have to watch your RPM. Spin it fast enough and it\\'s a shrapnel bomb. not sure id use it on the job site, but i would definitely carry it into battle against the office nerds If you‚Äôd installed the guard properly upon unboxing, it actually would not have fit. I hope it‚Äôs a joke... that kickback could literally kill you Single family residential foreman here. Had a guy do this to cut nichiha siding at a brick transition and nearly cut off 4 fingers after kick back Nah bro. Legit you‚Äôll be dead Had a Mason put a diamond blade for a stihl saw on a 9\" grinder. Kicked back on him and now he has a scar from his shoulder to the opposite hip. hope he\\'s got the ER on speed dial No way.. nuh uh.. never.. No joke did this with my grinder 6 months or so ago (albeit with a 4.5\" blade) and almost cut off my finger.  Surgery and 20+ doctor visits later my finger still can\\'t straighten.  I had done it plenty of times before, but never again.. I usually put a 6 inch abrasive cutting blade on when I have a ton of cutting to do and don\\'t want to switch blades every 2 minutes. I legit saw a guy from a clients‚Äô crew of property managers carrying this setup on a job. I heard it too‚Äî always made sure I wasn‚Äôt in the room. I have the same angle grinder, it has a guard that would not allow that blade to fit My dad once put a 7 1/4\" steel cutting blade on a 4 1/2\" angle grinder to cut brick.  Somehow he survived without killing himself. After spending the last week revamping my company\\'s safety policies, this made head hurt You know if you  can put a 6 1/2\" on there you can also put a 12\" Guy in Seattle carves sculptures with a grinder and series of different size saw blades. He told me he was lucky to survive the learning process. Get this facebook shit out of here.      This is a really bad idea. So epic, so true A brand new boss I had did this with a grinder on my first day working with him. Sliced right into his hand, spent the day at the hospital. I quit a week later, self made danger has no place on a worksite The self service finger slicing machine? um... do my eyes deceive me or is that blade on... backwards? Stay safe, good man. Keep up the good work! Looks like you hate Dewalt products? Nice op, I‚Äôm trying to keep that attitude but frankly at night I‚Äôm grateful to be working but during the day I doubt my ‚Äúessential job‚Äù. A lot of our customers are really disrespectful about giving space and no matter which tact I take they need to be constantly reminded. Some employees are just as bad. Nice set up man! Keep up the good work! So I see two Stabila levels???? Making bands I see Be safe, keep the hard work and stay positive! (Like I see your doing) cheers! You and me both, and we have the same saw! Stay healthy sir I am working on my house for a while, until a project opens up where i will be the only one there for about a month.   I am a Milwaukee guy, but used to have an entire Dewalt set up. That looks nice and professional. Looks like a nice setup!    We\\'re still working residential in Minnesota.     We just started a framing new house and all the neighbors love to stop and watch us work (we\\'re setting roof trusses now).     Some of them have yelled questions from the street, lol. Mostly from the kids.    I think Construction still going kinda gives people hope.    I love that were working, but our crew is only four guys on a lake lot, I\\'d be less thrilled if I was a Commercial jobs with 50 guys. plumber here (rural america), had the whole crawlspace to myself all day, no traffic driving around. Everyone on the job site was following the rules PPE, distancing etc. It might be nice to have people calming down and acting more neighborly, but it does not out weigh the terror that these big cities and hospitals are going through, i hope everyone is staying safe, and your families are well. Washington state won\\'t even allow solo projects like yours...  https://petitionbuilder.org/petition/construction-work-is-essential-mwsz--2?fbclid=IwAR2jJFXd0sc-ZnGB2cDpNBKW7K6p8xziz5cbYE31BMCVOvLnBau1-5PkcgI Paradise I‚Äôve been working on vacation homes the last two weeks, so I feel pretty safe, until the damn subs show up without any PPE and get in your face. Just going a little slower and being more careful and do regular phone check ins with my husband. Nice! I love that Dewalt saw stand, aren\\'t those just the best? Until today I had a month to turn over a town house. Painted the walls, took seven doors to the strippers, and started working the punchlist. The doors came back last Friday and I put the final coat on today. Then around two I got a panic\\'d text from the owner. The new tenant (who\\'d last week said May 1st,) wants to move in tomorrow... Oh the joy. Until he rips out all the grade stakes and to play fetch with them! /s  That\\'s pretty cool though. Wouldn\\'t fly on my job sites for insurance reasons but I\\'d love to have a job site mascot.   Winter of 2015-2016, we were putting up a small pole barn. On a random day a [black lab](https://imgur.com/gallery/3KkjEk3), with no tags, gray hair around the snout, and skinny enough to see ribs, came by. Nicest dog in the world, fell asleep on my coat, just hung around us for the day. Then we never saw it again. Kind of a bummer I wanted to adopt it, it looked like it had no home.   Oh man, we just had a job site and my boss had to bring his dog considering we had to camp for a week or so. You ever seen a chihuahua refuse to back down to a truck delivering trusses? Fucking great.  [I used to bring my pup when I‚Äôd check on our crews.](https://imgur.com/gallery/irIsE79)  One time an architect brought his St. Bernard to an OAC. It shat on the floor twice while he was walking the site. I\\'ve got a pup that is definitely \"that dog\". He hops on the mail truck while our mail chick circles the cul-de-sac, jumps on the UPS truck for a quick inspection when they show up, (chases the FedEx guy for some reason), and was an honorary \"Fire Dog\" for a few hours when a neighboring property set fire to a wooded area out back.  He rolled with the firefighters for a few hours around here and spent time inspecting two of their trucks from the cabs to every open storage locker he could climb into.  Little guy runs this cul-de-sac like he was elected mayor.  Even gets called by my neighbor when they\\'ve got leftover protein or bones from dinner.  He\\'s got this place clocked.  I\\'m guessing the Good Boy supervising the construction site runs his street too.  Their personalities are amazing.  No steel toes or safety glasses so were gonna have to send him home for the day.  My dog comes to the job every day. I usually take him on a walk around lunch when nobody\\'s working but he has to stay in the trailer most of the day. He has the same vest as the dog pictured above. Don\\'t... You dare... Cry! You\\'re on a worksite! The other men will see yo-... Oh... everybody is crying out of cuteness it\\'s ok then :\\') There\\'s a white hound with brown spots that roams a job site I\\'m currently at. He likes to watch the equipment and run in the mud but he won\\'t come anywhere near anyone. We call him yard dog.  Train him to fetch the laser for the pipe at the end of the day. Best pipe pupper There is nothing better than a dog roaming a job site! Had a  small terrier turn up on site one day and put on a cute face for a few days. All very cute till it snuck into my truck and ate all my lunch...being younger then meant I was full I great ideas, so I caught it and sprayed its coat day glow orange with chalk paint. It was all pretty funny till a huge tattooed builder that was working down  the road stormed into site with the highlighter dog under his arm and screamed \"RIIIIGGGHTT - what motherfuckers getting a punch in the head\" All dogs that came on my site go a piece of red flagging tied to their collar. The dog\\'s owners thought it was really funny and knew where he had been all day. He‚Äôs gonna be pooping blood later. looks like something out of trailer park boys Randy? Is that you? No safety harness?  Yes officer, it was him. At least he won‚Äôt get vibration white finger using that method How the f is this guy affording a hilti? The origin of the waist trimmer belt. Guys tryna get *J A C K E D* What song is playing I can do that too, hahahahaha When the extra $600 of unemployment runs out....... RANDY BO BANDY!! FUCKIN CHEESEBURGER GUT !!!! What else is that guy drilling in Grandma‚Äôs house? üòé This is okay if they are social or interested in the work we do. But to just stand there and stare is really annoying. Price just went up by 50% I was a helper for an hvac tech when I was in high school and whenever a customer wouldn\\'t leave him alone or wouldn\\'t stop asking questions he\\'d just put his tools down and talk with them until they realized they were paying to talk to him Not exaggerating, price increases from this. Usually sneak a 10% bitch tax in there. Unusual pickiness will get it too. I\\'ve told a homeowner doing this to go away before. He got all huffy and said it was his house,  he can do what he wants.  I asked him how he would feel if his boss came into his office and silently stared at him for 2 hrs and without a word he turned around and went into the other room. Im pretty sure he was just standing around ther corner listening but at least he stopped staring.  Never worked fore him again though, c that\\'s for sure. I am a retired tradesman, and have watched a lot of the work on my home, due to injuries or lack of physical agility my hands don‚Äôt work like they used to.  So I had to hire subs to do the work . I have seen many shortcuts being taken and not doing the job they were paid to do.  If your paying for the work you should be allowed to inspect the work.  Every tradesman knows there are some skilled guys and not so skilled guys.  It‚Äôs the not son-skilled guys on a crew you need to watch. If I recognize that the work being done is good i can be on my way.  Also that roof is almost flat. I\\'ve had a few customers do this but for the most part I think it was out of boredom and sincere interest in what I\\'m doing.  It still bugs the shit out of me but usually after a while they get bored with that too and leave. Next level...cause he\\'s on the roof with them. I have three pricing schemes.  \\\\#1 - Regular install. You tell me what you want, we talk about it, if anything comes up we talk about that.  \\\\#2 - You\\'re gonna hang out, watch me and shoot the shit. Price doubles, you\\'re either trying to figure out how to do it so you don\\'t call me next time (or at least until you already fucked it up) or you\\'re gonna waste my time talking to me.  \\\\#3 - you\\'re gonna watch me and want me to explain. Price quadruples because fuck you I don\\'t wanna do the job but if you bite I\\'ll do it. I have done this but I usually preface it with \\'do you mind if I watch for a bit? I\\'d like to learn a little. I want to know when I should be calling the professionals instead of making it worse by trying to fix it myself.\\' But then I leave after a few minutes.  Also, if someone isn\\'t at least willing to show me the general idea or explain what they are doing I don\\'t trust them; not on my house, and certainly not on any large job. I wouldn‚Äôt let the homeowner use my ladder. Then it‚Äôs my liability. If he wants to get on the roof do it with your own equipment. A few farts usually do the trick... Call safety inspectors for your jurisdiction On a window install last week my coworkers had a homeowner sit right behind them a while watching you tube videos on how to install windows. It did not go well. Everyone has there own way of doing things and of course they weren\\'t exact with what the video had. Yall couldn\\'t building refineries and Chem plants, you got ten mofos bird dogging you all day everyday Its all fun and games until the homeowner slips climbing down your ladder and sues your company ‚ÄúMY INSURANCE REQUIRES YOU TO BE 50 FEET AWAY FROM ANY WORK BEING DONE‚Äù I had a customer literally set up a web cam so he could watch us while he was away. Have the picture somewhere. Guy was a surgeon and anal as hell about every little thing. When it was all said and done. He tipped me 100$. Still would prefer not to be recorded though. I don‚Äôt think a picture has ever irritated me this much. I don‚Äôt blame him, roof work can have the shadiest shit going on because the owner will most likely never see it What type of van is that? I just has this on a service change and generator inlet install side job. The guy was never more then 10 ft away and demanded explanation for fucking everything..... Strippers prefer viewers. Old mechanics sign..  Work $50 /h You watch $60/h You watch and talk $80/h You help $100/h  That said I\\'m happy for the client (or their kids) to watch. I will point out it will go slower and cost more. Every time I leave a contractor alone they do some fucked up half assed work. This usually involves a call back, and they want more money to fix his original fuckup.  Last guy said he was going to add a relay to my furnace, and he did. It was laying right on the floor inside the unit all wired up. Next guy left three screws loose, switch wouldn‚Äôt work right. $120 to tighten three screws. The one and only time I\\'ve ever lost it with a customer was in a case like this. They hovered and they criticised and they had the temerity to tell me how to do my job witboit the benifit of my training and experience...  Just the worst. I\\'m always cool with people about doing dumb shit. But I won\\'t let ya die during work. We have pod meeting and it\\'s amazing how many chins go down when I bring up safety. Safety is for dorks. Dorks that want to go home alive with all their bits still attached. Companies only care about safety if it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of profits.  Hear me out, what‚Äôs the biggest thing every construction company claim they live by? ‚ÄúSafety 24/7.‚Äù However, on just about every job site I‚Äôve been on, there are blatant safety violations. This isn‚Äôt a simple case of guys not wearing safety glasses. This is guys riding around in buckets, standing on unsecured loads to use as ladders, and so on. Most of the time I‚Äôve realized it isn‚Äôt that guys don‚Äôt want to be safe, but are basically told to ‚Äúget it done‚Äù by any means possible. This means that often times the proper safety equipment isn‚Äôt available, or it causes significant delays that affect the bottom line. I definitely don‚Äôt agree with this mindset, but I understand why it happens.  Construction is obviously a cutthroat business, where literally time is money. This is why people get agitated when the safety guy shows up, because they know they can‚Äôt run at maximum speed if they‚Äôre required to follow all safety regulations. For a lot of guys, this means the higher-ups questioning them for why it took so long to get something done, so they equate the safety guy to someone standing in the way of production and as someone who only ends up getting them in trouble.  There definitely needs to be change in safety, but it has to happen at the very top with management. They have to understand that safety comes at a cost, and that cost is productivity. Until then, guys will continue to shrug off safety measures in order to appease management. Man... as a redneck that used to do some dumb shit on residential sites, safety can sometimes go overboard. But I‚Äôve also seen a guy unclip his fall protection too early and then fall through a skylight 30 feet to his death on a concrete floor. Do your job well, or find someone that lets you do your job well. There‚Äôs no excuses and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to find that out the hard way. As long as your not an arrogant SOB who thinks he knows more about my trade and our safe work practices, than your alright by me. I try to get along with everyone and Remind myself your just doing your job.   But when it becomes over bearing and a daily thing, that‚Äôs when we got issues. That‚Äôs why my company usually hires their own safety guy to deal with you guys on site. Saves a lot of arguments. Is it reasonabe to fire someone for refusing to follow safety guidelines? I have a day worker (europe) who absolutely refuses to wear a dust mask while sanding down some doors. I buy the guy a dust mask during a pandemic (much harder than normal), and he refuses to wear it, saying he\\'s tough and from region X (a part of europe with loads of coal mines). He\\'s just 23 and I feel like I\\'m resposible for him. I even had to tell him thrice to bring the sanding work outside. This tough guy attitude is so stupid. If I tell you to put your hard hat on, it means put your fucking hard hat on or leave.  It‚Äôs not a suggestion. As a safety guy... I relate so much If you show images of what can happen if proper safety protocol isn‚Äôt followed, people will likely be more interested in listening.  Easier to relate when you see a mutilated body part. No you aren‚Äôt. Good luck my friend Be glad we have work when so many others don‚Äôt. Take proper precautions. Be aware of symptoms. And cut yourself off from your older family, as this will likely save them from exposure. Remember we are all essential. Regardless of what anyone tells us. Sorry to hear man! We‚Äôre all in the same boat. Every country, every state, every job site. Stay safe! We are in the same boat in America, my job isn\\'t even that important but we keep working and we don\\'t even have masks, gloves or disinfectant. God bless Sri Lanka. Beautiful country. Stay safe my friend What project are you building? Stay safe brother Covid is kill?  No. But think of the stockholders! Be safe! Keep on keeping on. I feel for you mate. Our company ceased all work last Friday. Take care. That\\'s one Hell of a boss right there. Wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier to make a fold down elevator, or build a ramp to get it in? Awesome, I wonder  if anyone manufactures machines adapted for wheelchair users from factory I don‚Äôt believe this is really ‚Äúmodified by his boss‚Äù.  I‚Äôm fairly certain it came that way from the factory.  A friend of mine uses a big John Deere one for loading large diameter pipe on rail cars and his came with a cab like that.   It allows him to safely get into the cab and then goes up like 20‚Äô so he has a better view of loading the rail cars   It‚Äôs cool but I bet his boss is still a dickhead I‚Äôd like to see this in a real work scenario For a second I thought he was posing next to the wrecked machine that fucked his legs up. That\\'s Frickin awesome! Nextfuckinglevel Please enlighten me. I may have been wrong before once or twice. Also how can I get in this crew? It\\'s fake. But a testament to the human spirit. If willing.  You will find a way. >chimical splashback  Yup that\\'s a construction site alright. Ah damn. I thought it was every turd over 3\". I\\'ve been extra safe all these years You need to preload a bit of TP in advance as a landing pad. Everyone agrees, a 12‚Äù+ turd that requires no wipe is a start to a good day. One ponders their previous day diet in hopes of recreating such a feat. This is a universal rule, salary and wage. It‚Äôs a rare occurrence that we all share in this accomplishment. Length? Or Width? Is that measured linear along the center line of the turd? Like if if I\\'ve got a long sweep 90 elbow on the end and my end to center measurement is 6\" taking into account fecal allowance but overall is about 13\" 5/8 am I good? OSHA Approved It seems like I see this joke every other week. Is it to much to ask for a little originality from my portapotty humor. I like how these things mysteriously tip over in the middle of the night after the General Contractor is too cheap to have the proper amount and have them emptied regularly... You just through a bunch of toilet paper in and it will land on the paper stopping the splash back My OHS policy, Section 1: - always shit before going to work because fuck site toilets That‚Äôs weird mine says 4‚Äù Why the hell do the idiots feel the need to write on the pissers?  Edit: for all of you who complain that construction workers aren‚Äôt respected you can point to this thread as the reason why (the majority of the people here think it‚Äôs ok to destroy our own washroom with bad recycled jokes and racist graffiti).  You get what you give.  I‚Äôll wear these downvotes as a crown. At least you got it out of the way for friday. That\\'s why you go home at 3:30 üòÅ It\\'s just having a cat nap Did you have to call safety? Oh shit just noticed that‚Äôs a new machine too. Woof. And that‚Äôs why you keep the door on üí™üèº Oooof, what was that experience like? Any major damage to the machine? Glad you‚Äôre okay! I‚Äôve fallen and I can‚Äôt get up. Just call the rental, and Karen the fuck out of the call about how you specifically asked for outriggers WALL-E NOOOOOOO!!!! I know of a guy who flipped a bobcat into a few feet of water and drowned. They couldn‚Äôt get him out I\\'ve gotten one stuck in the mud but never this It‚Äôs a trap! Don‚Äôt scratch its belly or it‚Äôll attack you! Every day is Monday in construction That looks like a friday 3pm fuck up to me At least the silt fence is okay That ll buff right out!! Just roll her back over Looks like somebody\\'s got a case of the Mondays! It‚Äôs just tired, pretty sure it‚Äôs napping. Awh poor kitty I haven\\'t seen anyone else asking this, so I will: how the fuck do you flip a track skid steer? \"So that wall comes out.. 1689? 1869?\"  \"Jesus Christ Bill it\\'s a pandemic, wear your prescription safety glasses\" Ha! Just now I was going through some questions on the plans with my framer. We each stood at opposite ends of an 8\\' table with our own set of plans. Calling out page numbers and details to each other. It took me WAY too long to figure out what‚Äôs going on here. At first I thought you were modeling a 3 phase Wye distribution with tape measures. Don\\'t let your tips touch, thats gay. *Cries in Washington State* This is hilarious to me because I‚Äôm on a non-essential jobsite that has no running water or hand sanitizer and everyone gets close to one another and no one gives a fuck because they think it‚Äôs a hoax.   Fucking scabs. Just don\\'t cross streams. \"I see your Schwartz is as big as mine\" What exactly is going on in this pic? I legitimately thought you were talking about your dick for 34 seconds and was like oh shit it‚Äôs because of the *FUCKING* üá®üá≥ü¶† Can I share this on my business page as a meme? I can tag you and give you credit! Half the jobs i‚Äôve worked has just consisted of a bunch of dudes just wandering around asking each other if they knew where the _____ was [deleted] This is why all the journeymen I used to work for enforces the tool belt It‚Äôs in your truck somehow Every single day pencils, pliers, tape measure, level or when people ask me for it and I said they had it last because I let them use it. Being a plumber and having way too many tools and materials in my work space, I sometimes think how many minutes are spent JUST looking for the thing I used a second ago. So much efficiency lost... I need help If I set it down I usually know where it is  But of someone moved it I\\'m totally screwed ‚ÄúHey...where‚Äôs your belt?‚Äù I say this about 5 times a day on average to our newest guy. Having to run across the house to get your belt on so you can tell me how long something is is a good way to get a peepee smack This happens at home as well. Then I spend half the time finding the tool or material, and half on the project. did you look right where you left it? Ok... This is what you got to do...  Get a belt you like. A nice thick leather one. Should look like a old school weight lifter belt. Not to thick....you still want to get bags and shit on it.   Get one bag that fits your tools nicely. Place it on your dominant hand side. This is where you keep your tape, hammer, snips... Whatever hand tool you use. Especially.... Your pencil. Be like ninja swift with your hands. Don\\'t fuck around.   On your least dominant side.. Place your fasteners... Maybe your square too..   Get nice tools. They are yours and you love them. They love you too. Let no one touch them. If you are carrying the weight of them they are yours.   The belt at first might be strange.. But then you will come to the most fascinating realization... That you are, becoming the belt. Suddenly you want to measure some shit.. And you found your tape at the same speed as finding your bird when wanting to take a wiz.. Just natural.   Good talk! Now go make money! Yeah me 2, most of the times it\\'s in my holster or my pants but I still spend way to much time looking for it I wish I had that discipline to have a stocked tool belt that I actually used.  My toolchest is the same way, about once every 2 months I gather up all the freekin\\' tools I have used in buckets, other drawers and resort them as they are a mess. They say we can spend as much as 20% of our time looking for stuff. Some days it sure feels like more. The worst is safety glasses on my helmet or hat. More embarrassing than anything. That or pencil behind ear. \"hey George! Where a fu..k is my pencil!!?! Is... It in your other hand,? If you had your bags on you‚Äôd know where it was all the time What did i just do with that thing in my hand just now. - me at LEAST 14 times a day. No joke. I was working under a deck replacing and taking down boards two days ago and I swear I\\'ve never lost a tool that many times in that tiny of a confined space There\\'s no irritation like something vanishing off the face of the earth 9 seconds after using it. At least I\\'m not alone. Best part is I have a pouch to carry shit in, then when I use it, I never put it back. 15 minutes into a task, my pouch is empty and my tools are all over the ground. I thought I was the only adult to loose things that fast. LOL Did you know that walking through a doorway or a portal has an effect in your mind that makes you forget things?     It\\'s like a program or application in your computer that does not accept an outside source or file format for copy paste.  A woman gets off a bus with one boob out of her blouse...  After a while a man asks  the obvious question pointing at the glaring tit \"Ma\\'am is this some  form of treatment for breast cancer?\" The woman in sudden realization  yells \"Oh my God! my Baby\". \"Why the fuck would I put it there?!\" A lot of time wasted I would have went to happy hour.  Fuck that nonsense Beautiful deck though! Why are you standing in it? Ya, no. We would‚Äôve been wrapping it up way before that. We have a rule, if the dirt in a circle we made is soaked. We‚Äôre done! Fuck working in the rain. If those bags are that full, you\\'ve been either standing still for too long or they got filled for internet points. Okay now drink it üò∂ If the ground is soaked, I don‚Äôt work. Not only is it unsafe for myself and my workers, it‚Äôs just generally bad conditions and leads to poorer workmanship. Love the Oxy belt Would have been sitting In my truck once it started to sprinkle. The quickest way to a grumpy contractor is me having to work with wet feet I was caulking the front door to a commercial structure I built in Kentucky one time, dark thirty, with some scant overhead relief, and it was pouring down rain. Pouring. Down rain.     A supplier lady called me and said, \"I see it\\'s raining cats and dogs there.\"     \"Yes ma\\'am, I just stepped in a poodle.\"     She liked it so much she called my leadership to commend me on my wit. (Many know the joke, apparently she didn\\'t) It\\'s time to go home. I\\'ve been doing a cut and cover trench job with minimal over dig.  At any given time, my bags have as much dirt and gravel in them as nails (from rubbing against the bank setting Symons). A lot of people in this thread must be made of sugarüòÇ  Our crew usually works in the rain That\\'s been almost everyday for the last 5 weeks..... Plus side, don\\'t need a shower...... I like empire torpedo levels too. Lol. My rain gear has a Toyota badge The things we do for a buck Lol the occidentals really hold the water üòÇ Your bags dont have drains? Dang man. I appreciate you. that belts gonna smell and feel great tomorrow... Thanks for reminding me what I don\\'t miss about the field. Rats. Get out the rain. Time for a Home Depot run Good on ya bud. Nothin worse than working days when youre wet through. It will be a day you remember though. Those days where you struggle in the elements will be the ones you remember Seems like a monday issue....  Pack-it up boys! We\\'re quittin early. That nail doesn\\'t give a fuuuuuuuuck Hazard freight strikes again $10-20 and it\\'s probably lasted a few years at least. I love it when I get to buy a crowbar, always a good time.  Fortunately, that\\'s not an expensive tool. Just a word of warning about this exact task. A neighbour was pulling nails from some timber with a nail bar. The timber lying on the ground, He was standing over it on heaving on each nail one by one.   One nail was jammed in pretty good....he applied force on the bar and the head came off the nail and shot into his eye with permanent damage. He can still see from it but it\\'s pretty fucked up. Just so ye know. Work safe.    Why are your osb boards blue on the corners? I watch \"the crazy framer\" and his are blue as well, so i guess it\\'s common in the US but i\\'ve never seen those  Seems like a monday issue....  Pack-it up boys! We\\'re quittin early. sorry for your loss YAY!!  NEW TOOLS!! Time for a bigger bar  You are SO strong!! That‚Äôs comin out your check son Looks like it was well used and abused. Did her job well while she could.  I broke the groove wheel of a Ridgid 915 today on a piece of 1-1/2 black steel. I guess that\\'s why they say you should file down the weld seam On OSB too OH SNAP!! That aint right. That‚Äôs a roll-up, boys. Build me a house with those nails! I\\'ve damn near straight some flat bars put on stuff, but I\\'ve never broken one like this. Very impressive.     Love pulling on Commons, lol. That‚Äôs actually impressive if you did that by hand  First time i seen one broke LOTR Theoden Meme: \"You have no power here, Stanley Yellowbar!\" Ring shanks can be a real pain in the ass when you have to pull them! I must say, that\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen that happened... Made in China Americanesium  Was it cold out? I break a lot of tools in cold weather.  That‚Äôs Home Depot grade for you, made in China üá®üá≥  They\\'re recreational bungee jumpers right? Right?  I\\'m just imagining the reaction of the foreman seeing this video, or even better, seeing it from the site office and I honestly can\\'t stop laughing. Imagine if the on-site safety guy walked around the corner in time to see this...he would literally shit a chicken. *Looks for OSHA*  It looks fun.  Can I try? Lol At least they had proper PPE No high viz vest. That‚Äôs a write up. u/vredditDownloader How do you get back up? R/osha SSHO approves Jesus Slightly worse then leaning a 6\\' ladder against the wall to reach something off the 2nd step. Slightly. Harness and lanyards need to be replaced, as do the crew. Why is that dipshit standing on the load. Look at the whitehat just casually walking up. This type of stuff makes me embarrassed.  I feel like we see videos like this all the time from 2nd & 3rd world countries. Places with lack of education, training, regulation, and equipment.  But there is NO excuse for something this big to happen in the states. We have every resource available to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen. More importantly, the operator and rigger don\\'t seem to have properly inspected their equipment before use.  Also,  I doubt standing on the panel was in their lift plan.   Ultimately, this falls back on the Superintendent and/or Safety Officer. Pendejos Tilt up, fall down Anyone know where this was at? Who gets fired here? Having worked around idiots like this, you know they always belittled any training or oversight also.  In my area of the Midwest these would all be guys from hick towns who brag about how good of welders they are, talk down to everyone that isn‚Äôt in their clique, have zero ability to plan and communicate, and read and regurgitate pro-trump crap from Facebook all day.  Their defense is invariably ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing it this way for years and we never killed anyone before.‚Äù Holy christ, that only took 20 seconds to happen.... \"Fetchez le vache.  What? Fetchez le vache.\"  \"RUN AWAY!\" Pretty sure the guy standing on the load was just enough to go over the rated load limit for the crane, hence why it failed and tipped over **/s** Why‚Äôs the dude who fell over get up slower than an 80 year old I‚Äôd be outta there A round of fresh underwear for the crew please! Yep. If they were stoned this would have never happened. This is why everyone should cast in place concrete! Nice scary.. there was some uncertainty as to which was the crane was gonna fall... damn Operator should\\'ve dumped the load the moment it started swinging around dangerously. You can always make another panel. Anyone know where this was? Even if that had gone right that‚Äôs a stupid way to lift a load imo.   I‚Äôm from the U.K. and that approach wouldn‚Äôt make it past the proposal stage.   Surely to god there is a jig that could allow that tilt without putting people in the lifting zone? This was supposed to be a reply to a different comment. It\\'s not a \"mistake\" to call in sick if you\\'re sick, especially right now. Hopefully he gets well soon so you can both enjoy the joke. And hopefully he didn\\'t have the virus or it won\\'t be very funny for you having touched all his stuff. Damn that\\'s a nice set up for an assistant super, I wish I had that set up. Is that a 2019 calendar? Glad I‚Äôm not the only one that calls my jobsite the daycare center. Lol. How many teenagers work in that office? serious question, how are yalls jobsites handling this thing? my site is large with 50+ people minimum. they as of now are not shutting us down. this may change in the coming days but I\\'m curious about other locations. My favourite part is the water bottle.  What state are you? I\\'m in pa... shut down today- Friday This is the bullshit that people not call in sick when calling in when you\\'re sick is entirely the right thing to do, with or without the coronavirus pandemic. This shit needs to stop. I don\\'t know why we in construction feel the need to perpetuate bullshit and take what should be a normal good job and add in all this bullshit that makes it sucks. I know the perps here \"were just joking.\" Stop. You fucking jokes are stupid. How about you just stfu and work? Safety first Sad to see that. Not alot of professionalism. Ah yes... so good ole fashion office pranks... the world needs more of this right now Fair enough That‚Äôs some high quality humour there.  Keep it up.  I hope there‚Äôs some kind of surprise in a drawer.  Like a tuna sandwich Drug test coming up in 3...2..1.. I thought the rubber side was meant to be the bottom I am glad you are safe.  machine can be fixed & replaced. Life cannot.  be safe! Sleepy wiggle wagon ohh look the cat want some petting If it makes you feel any better, off road trucks flip over A LOT. Hope you‚Äôre okay Did you guys just flop it back over with a digger? Have your seatbelt on? She wants you to scratch her belly That sucks... glad you are ok. Gotta ask, how did the company take it?  I scratched some windows on a garage door at work once and the boss man flipped the shit out.  Probably because he wandered around and looked out them alot on his afternoon \"check in\" with his coffee....  Sucks when shit like this happens.  Shakes your nerves for some time after, at least it does me. At least the front didn\\'t fall off. Tipped her over empty. That\\'s impressive. A bank give away or something? How was the ride? Didja have a nice trip? Shake hands with danger https://youtu.be/v26fTGBEi9E Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre supposed to articulate on multiple axises... Cat tipping. So...what happened? Oops, new county, new job. Move on Wow, flipped the cab as well. Tough luck dude but glad you‚Äôre doing ok. Damn that\\'s scary. Hope you\\'re ok!! Fucked up rebar lists at work at Thursday and the fallout might be just as bad as fixing that. But hey, happy little accidents right? Nice... that cab is fucked. Gonna need to be replaced now lol Yup youre fired m8. Pretty neat but that\\'s definitely not cement. Why does everyone think everything is called cement? What material are those blocks? It looks like he is picking them up easily for being so large. What a waste of time to load that thing with mortar. How many uses can you get out of it before it‚Äôs so caked with shit that it‚Äôs worthless?  Trowel is way faster and more efficient. *mortar  Yawn... tried and tested, its slow even with the video sped up... I will stick to my trowel thanks Motherfucker is wearing crocs....just sayin If this guy was a pro he would upgrade his tools to diamond. Looks like he is also building a house out of sandstone blocks. Definately not creeper safe. I have pictures of my 1900\\'s warehouse being build using a box like this to lay the mortar bed...nothing new Pretty fancy, but I‚Äôd like to see his shoe tying abilities.  Good trick of the trade  That\\'s aac block Those blocks are dry it will absorb moisture from that motor üòÅüòÄüòé  1st of all its concrete not cement. 2nd that\\'s mortar. Thanks nice to see some of the underground sub-systems that keep society rolling. That\\'s a lot of rebar in a sewer chamber.  NYCDEP? Is that guy doing his job? What is put around the 48\" CPP to keep the storm water from seeping out/around during construction? Also, does that material work? Installing manholes and doing CIPP repairs right now, but this is another level of coordination...good luck boss. How do you temp in the corrugated pipe? Are there penstocks or something to temp shutoff flow on the main line?  Is that CIP vault going to be open to all three outlets, or is a wye being formed between all the RCP sections and the vault just around that?  I\\'m curious about the sequence here. RCP = Rain Collection Pipe? From one UG guy to another, that is a nice picture & I would be proud. I believe companies that enforce safe & clean job sites always prevail over the corner cutters in the long run.  Thats badass Cool picture! Saw the pic before I read the title and thought this was a d-box for a waste water system. Then I noticed the guys... that‚Äôs awesome! Shotcrete? Nice work, good and clean job  As a GC, I wholeheartedly agree!  Some guys are like crackheads for PPE or small tools. ‚ÄúHey maaaaan, can I get some of those there safety glassssses?‚Äù No motherfucker, I‚Äôve already given you 3 pairs and 2 pairs of gloves. üòê  Edit: I have seen this in shops we‚Äôve done work in. The metro shops in DC have a setup like this for employees that need little stuff. They swipe their employee card and can get gloves, glasses, dust masks, etc. I thought it was a great idea. My company tried this for PPE, I don\\'t know why it never caught on.  It was great, you were allowed X amount of points per month to spend however you wanted.  People like me who kept track and took care of our stuff could get all the nice gloves and glasses and the irresponsible could get multiple pairs of the crap.  If you ran out of points you\\'d have to explain why and get personally issued whatever it was.  You can fuck off with the consumables like sawblades and cutoff wheels.  Not all tasks are created equal, some wear blades out quicker than others.  If I need a new blade, I need a new blade.  The time it\\'s going to take me to deal with this shit is going to cost more than just supplying me in the morning with extras. Aren\\'t companies supposed to comply with OSHA standards and supply employees with ppe? At least glasses and gloves. PPE is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt want to use a cutoff wheel that fell down right on its edge. Saves you from using the pink PPE/tools! I wouldn‚Äôt want my grinding disks and cutoff wheels falling like that. If these were common I\\'d probably wear a mask way more often than I actually do The sold out slots were the toilet paper and saftey glasses. Fucking great idea. Love it Where are the diablo blades though Out of curiosity, why are you using SupplyPro instead of Fastenal?  Are you getting better pricing?  Is there a feature that they have you prefer?  I\\'m not affiliated with either, just wondering. Great idea. How do I purchase one? It\\'s all fun and games until something gets stuck in the machine and the worker is not able to continue working and the boss is losing money every moment this machine does that. Who decides what gets placed in these? Are they prestocked? Refilled by a supply company?  &#x200B;  Or does the GC of the jobsite decide what gets placed in there? I was a truck driver and I once arrived at a yard that required safety glasses and general PPE. I had misplaced my safety glasses, and they directed me to the vending machine full of safety glasses and other items. Frikin sweet! I bought a hard had from their too, because it was nicer than mine Haha. The prices were very reasonable too. Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Am I the only one that finds the 10\" circular saw blades hilarious... Actually that whole right machine Absolutely! I have been on more than one project where the superintendent wears one of these unironically. (I\\'m in San Antonio) These are ANSI approved and absorbs a hit just the same as a regular hard hat so there‚Äôs no issue with these. That being said, you look like an idiot.  I\\'d be smashing the brim into every ever-loving thing. I\\'d have whiplash by the end of the week. In the almost 20 years I‚Äôve been working in construction, every person I‚Äôve seen wear these were complete douche bags.  these are ANSI approved but not CSA approved. no bueno for Canadian sites.  You get a lot of those here in Mexico too , to be honest I‚Äôm always jelly when I‚Äôm in the sun burning and they have that cool shade in their necks and face  Still a safety hazard, they can tell you to take it off if they want. General Clause I need this , together with steel toe cowboy boots  I remember seeing some website that was selling pink, gold, and US flag finished cowboy hard hats.  I found a pair of steel toed sneakers once, much nicer for warehouse work than boots, there was no end to the fussing about them.  Most of the flaggers in our area wear these during the summer. Lots more sun coverage! I see lots of these on all my projects. Not sure why Hispanics are so into cowboys  Janore Deonga approved. These are almost as bad as those cheapo ones with the V on the top  Tory Bruno at ULA has one/wears it regularly which is pretty awesome. I asked and he said the one he wore was code approved...so if it‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs safe!  Still love the idea in general, but can‚Äôt justify going out to buy one... i‚Äôd hit my camera on the brim too often. Holy shit my dad has one of these. No idea where he found it seeing as how he works in NJ/NY and I\\'ve never heard of a Polish cowboy. That happened so quick! I feel like Amished some stuff. And no sparkys to turn that frame into Swiss cheese! BTW that brief pause in the video was their lunch break üòÅ What a worthy day though. Not much for religion, but this is a fine example of folks working together. Jimmy Carter\\'s Habitat for Humanity is one of my favorite charities. I\\'d love to have a chance to work on one of these. The fellowship alone would be so memorable. Amish: What is this OSHA you speak of? Just imagine leaving for work and there\\'s not a damned thing on your neighbors property, then you return home amd there\\'s a completed mega barn. Team work makes the dream work. Plus 5 years of chopping trees down and cutting them to size with out modern tech or electricity Ants are such interesting creatures It‚Äôs a fine barn, but no pool it be English. and China thinks they\\'re hot shit for putting up a modular hospital in 10 days.... Anyone know what kind of construction costs these barns end up at ($/sf)?  And what do the Amish charge to have this done?  I‚Äôm curious how the financials work out.  Is it a set turn key price or materials plus labor? This is fake. There‚Äôs no way the electrician could have completed their roughs within that timeframe. If they‚Äôre so Amish then who filmed this They look like ants Its quite amazing what can be done when working together...‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è And no PPE in sight. You can build stuff real quick when there are no safety regulations. So if we were to try this in our world, is it cheaper to quote total job hours or lots of manhours? This is literally that scene from family guy Filmed by a non Amish neighbor, I assume? Thanks for sharing.  How do their labor rates compare to a regular contractor? Kind of cheating to start with the foundation and first floor walls already in place. how did they get the camera out there? What do they use for their waterproofing? I cant imagine they know what Tyvek is... Those are the kind of jobs that make me proud to work in residential lol ü§ôü§ô Off you phone, bastard! I completely agree. No other job task excites me more  Happy I left the depressing corporate world for an exciting outdoor job  Now they just need to pay me the same haha Atlanta! Lookin good man! I hope the sidewalk below you is closed. Sure doesn‚Äôt look like it here. It‚Äôs this type of shit that made me quit framing. Lol. Glad someone has the balls for it Facia? American Concrete Structures? How about dropping a few bucks on some lanyards that have elastic cord or at least a shock breakaway. A piece of chain would be a bitch to take a fall on. As a GC... Guys being on their cell phones while in a harness is a fuck no. Also... The lack of staging seems like a terrible idea.    Keep up the good work though. Stay safe. you spelled laborer wrong #nope I couldn\\'t do it I get nervous when roofing a 3 story house I couldn\\'t hang of the side of a building like that Are you a Carpenter or Hollywood stuntman? King of trades, brother id almost be more afraid of dropping something on somebody from that height You guys are badass. Someone\\'s shuttering haha So if that harness breaks, what catches you? Hell yea dog What are you doing? All I see is hooking up a lanyard.... I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more carpenters that also climb. Keep killin it bro! ...And here I am, building fucking Starbucks‚Äô and pouring sidewalks. Just putting this out there... the \"Chernobyl\" miniseries is fantastic. Follow it up with the \"Building Chernobyl\\'s Mega Tomb\" documentary (which is what is posted) for the full effect.   My wife (who barely knows a hammer from a screwdriver) loved them both. Does constructing the dome a couple hundred feet away from ground zero make that big of a difference? Maybe something to do with exponential decay. I saw this documentary on one of the brighter channels. Massive and admirable effort. [Heres how it looks today, cozy and safe.  ish.](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95e1b3a6-a3ae-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700) Can you explain, for the ignorant folks such as myself, what will it be serving for 100 years? There\\'s a really good podcast i think by \\'stuff you should know\\' about how to \\'hide\\' radioactive waste from far future generations.  Signs in current languages would only work for a few millennia before the languages evolved.  Symbols are mostly interpreted and would rely on some degree of scientific knowledge.  Imagine if a pandemic or similar event causes civilization to start again and some bronze age explorers found this structure.  It would soon become known as the cursed temple once people found a way to enter it. Not terrible, not great I never understood why they didn\\'t just shoot like a million yards of shotcrete on that thing and just be done with it. Couldn\\'t you demolish it so that it wouldn\\'t need a cover as big as this? Or will the dust and debris be radioactive and scatter everywhere? didnt it cost well over a billion dollars? I wouldn\\'t work in those conditions.  I hope you\\'re getting hazard pay I\\'m glad you\\'re still with us. Be sure to tell your loved ones how you feel  You better have puncture proof boots on that site!  Expect osha 7 am Monday. Worthy of sounding the air horn Wow I‚Äôm calling Osha. Those things can cause a nasty bruise on your heal. You‚Äôll be out for weeks maybe months. A clean job site is a safe job site.  All apparent impalement hazards must be capped/ protected.

[deleted] Rough day when you‚Äôre eating cat food huehuehue [deleted] Looks like the wrong tool for the job but I like your adaptability and creativity üëç Watched a guy eat lasagna with a plastic cup yesterday so be thankful you have a ruler spatula at least.. I guess. So the thumbnail on my phone made it look like you had a massive gash in your leg and you were measuring the depth with a ruler. Then I was super confused about the fork part of your title.   Glad I was mistaken... I‚Äôve been doing trim lately so I just cut 4 inches of cove wood molding.  Or I use a stick, or a shim. Never a fork. next time you go into a fast food restaurant, ask for those single wrapped spork... or spoons or forks whatever they have and throw them in your car.  Those are life-savers I have been carrying a camping set in my tool box for years. They nest together and always draw a combination of criticism and awe. Just trim down a shim/shingle and you‚Äôve got yourself a legit fork. Does no one use their driver\\'s license like a civilized person nowadays?!   (/s) One time I cut two small pieces of Ceiling wire and made chopsticks to eat my instant ramen lol Now I know what happened to my coffee stirrer I keep a fork and spoon in my center console for romantic dinners like this. Neil? My friend used measuring tape but this seems better The Bumblebee tuna ones come with a little plastic spoon. Then you don‚Äôt have to worry about it! 2‚Äù of tuna I‚Äôve seen guys use shims a lot. I‚Äôve also seen guys use a bag over their hand to eat some stuff. Better the fork than the spoon... They have some brands that have the spoon in the pouch...a fuckin life saver.... I thought that was a tear in your jeans and you were showing off the gnarliest accident wound I\\'ve ever seen Whenever I forget a fork or spoon a pair of my cleanest safety glasses is getting snapped in half right quick Ah yes.. I remember these days of eating things with minimal tools and heat while in my car come lunch time based on what random food stuff I hastily grabbed from the cupboard half conscious at 6:00am. It was as if  I was ransacking my own house in a post apocalyptic world while being chased by some indescribable horror.  Was I ever that young? Just use those dirty hands This pic looked really bad at first.  It looked like you had   Stabbed your leg with a framing square minus the blood. Second best use for a framing square. why eat in the car? First off, sorry for the pic quality. I‚Äôve been planning on carpentry and construction as a career, after taking carpentry and building/structure systems for the past 3 years in school, it only made me 100% sure that I wanted to start in a trade. I recently got accepted into a local union as an apprentice in commercial carpentry, also through a school program I was able to secure $1000 in scholarship funds for tools. Everything on the bottom is something I have bought over the past 2 years on my own (minus my Milwaukee m18 Vacuum and a few HD 12.0 batteries). Everything on the top was something I acquired today with my scholarship fund. I feel like this is a huge step forward for me and my future family, and I appreciate you guys for posting content and explaining things the way you have. Keep teaching us younger kids as long as you can! (Tools purchased today: Small tool box, linesman and end nipper pliers, 2 plumb bobs, a new chalk line, 6‚Äô folding rule, 3 pc. aviation snips, WTG framer tool belt (great quality, comparable to diamondback for about $250, handmade in my state of Ohio), crowbar, tekton 12pc screwdriver set, drywall saw, Irwin hand saw, small tool bag which is underneath the tool belt, my 2nd cats paw, 3 pc. Prybar set, and my personal favorite, stiletto 14 oz. titanium framer. Not pictured are 3 pairs of Carhartt work pants, Carhartt bibs and jacket, and Carhartt work socks as they were special ordered). Couldn\\'t agree more, I did the Registered Apprentice Program or RAP in highschool got into an awesome trade (fire protection systems installer) and I haven\\'t looked back love every minute of it. Good for you dude. I\\'m 24 now and still getting into doing remodel work. I went to school for a couple years doing drafting and did that for four years and decided desk jobs are fucking lame when I don\\'t have any skills from the field. I wish I went right into a trade. I recently quit my job for a custom home builder because my boss was a dickhead but I learned so much from them and it really solidified this is what I want to do as a career. I work for a window and siding place now, finally spending some money on tools that aren\\'t garbage and I hope to one day go out on my own. Working with my hands is one decision in my life so far that really makes me happy. Guys like you often retire very wealthy. Awesome initiative, love to see it. I‚Äôve been wanting to join my local union but I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll screw up somehow. Atta boy! There have been some great pieces of advice given here, I mostly just want to say keep your chin up! I have lots of respect for an apprentice that wants to get his own tools (especially quality tools) and isn\\'t always asking to borrow stuff.  I have lots more respect for an apprentice who is engaged, learning, and improving. The two often go hand in hand, bit sometimes there are guys that just seem to want the new shiny but don\\'t want to put in the work.  The industry needs guys like you, and if an asshole old timer gives you a hard time don\\'t let him get you down. Maybe there is something you need to learn from him. Maybe he\\'s a miserable asshole. Don\\'t dismiss criticism, and don\\'t let hurt feelings kill the joy of building cool shit. [deleted] You definitely spent some money on your set up. I just recently switched from dewalt tool to Milwaukee. I really like the Milwaukee m18. Congrats on your career choice! I start as a project engineer on June 1 and I\\'m similarly nervous. Just remember to ask questions and it\\'s much better to ask a question than to assume or pretend you know something. Everyone has been in your shoes and if you respect them, they will eventually respect you. It\\'s exciting to see young people in the field and seeing the benefits of hands on work. Coming from a guy who‚Äôs only experience with union‚Äôs is hearsay from friends... don‚Äôt sit on the opportunity to have representatives backing you every step of the way. Go for it. Nothing is easy in life, but you should always work smarter not harder. Unions are the smart move. I wish our school would have allowed hammers and saws. Nice job man. I highly recommend the Milwaukee packout system for your tools on site. Good start.. go get some experience though it‚Äôs all brand new? Label your shit it will be stolen or ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù soon enough Just wanna say, some people don\\'t like them but I\\'ve had my two stilettos for almost 20 years. They have been excellent. Although the texture is almost totally worn off my framer, still hits great. 15 years as an ironworker and seams ever year there are less younger people coming in. So that\\'s awesome your joining the trades and proud of it! Enjoy yourself and be proud of your work. Be safe have fun. Cheers mate good luck and work safely. There are always pluses and minuses to either route. Considering getting your construction management degree is not a bad option either. I\\'m in the industrial sector and lots of the tradespeople have been out of work in my area as crews were dramatically reduced in size when shutdowns were enacted where as me and other people I graduated with stayed employed the whole time. Neither is right or wrong, but it\\'s good to consider all possible scenarios. I‚Äôm 30 and I went the business school route, college and all that, it was boring. It‚Äôs worked out for me ok, but I often daydream about trying to secure a carpentry apprenticeship and really learning the trade beside hobby woodworking. Agreed. I‚Äôm 26 and I make more than my dad who‚Äôs an electrical engineering tech. He went to school and the whole bit. Trades are the way to go. And no student loans. I‚Äôm still paying for my 2 years of misguided partying. Good for you! I finished my commercial carpentry apprenticeship in 03. I‚Äôm now a superintendent making six figures. It‚Äôs a great career with a pretty high ceiling. There will be ups and downs but stick with it, it‚Äôs very rewarding! Milwaukee makes some decent tools.   Won‚Äôt take away from that.     But consider switching brands.  Milwaukee and empire (amongst some others) are owned by a Chinese company.  It won‚Äôt take long for you to understand keeping money here when/where you can.  Dewalt is American owned and assembled.   Other brands are hit and miss. That‚Äôs the worst advice I‚Äôve ever ducking heard working for a living sucks I\\'d look into buying a Paslode gas nailer. Most larger pawnshops will have them available, or you can buy new for a pretty penny. Good luck out there. How is a picture of tools helpful or relevant? Why don\\'t you tell them about the 60+ hours a week you\\'ll have to work. The constant shuffling around of jobs and locations, getting rained out for days if not weeks at a time. Missing kids events. Being surrounded by a bunch of uneducated goons who\\'s operative word on the job site is \"Fuck\". Having to work in 90+ degree weather or subzero temperatures.   You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, you just went to Home Depot... [deleted] This is fucking sweet Apparently they\\'re adding a separate services to put a artificial waterfall inside the quarry. Would be interesting to see this project when its finished. Need a big diving board Id imagine they bought the land for a really low price. I know homeowner\\'s insurance is higher if you have a pool, I can\\'t imagine what it would be like to underwrite this. I wonder, were they selling that land there? Or it‚Äôs possible to just pick a piece of land as long as it‚Äôs not a preservation and purchase it? [deleted] How fun for kids! That excavation must have been hell. Minecraft IRL. That be cool. Post some pics of the surroundings op. Any chances of uranium in the water? [deleted] r/evilbuildings Inspiration?  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Fallingwater_-_DSC05639.JPG/500px-Fallingwater_-_DSC05639.JPG The chinese have built a [hotel in a quarry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eClDkXzKdGM) Thats pretty fucking sweet, but how do you know that its like, safe? Good luck exploring the infinite abyss. Yes. This is gonna be a top lister on Airbnb, haha. Hope they will have lots of mosquito screens. You live by the quarry? I live by the quarry too! We should hang out and throw things down it! Freakin awesome. Please post more pics if/when you can. Not really a mansion, looks like about 80\\'x30\\' walkout, or just under 5000 sq ft. Bigger than the Average, but not that much bigger to constitute mansion status [deleted] Did dude on the left shart himself Somebody should superimpose this video with a soundtrack of an irish jig lol Hmm, this explains why The Guatemalan Piledriver is such a lame wrestling move compared to the WWE version Dangerous or not ya gotta respect people like this that are really in the struggle This is why armies break cadence when crossing a bridge. They need to be 100% tied off... lol mexican backhoe, but those look like filipinos Looks like some of the work in Los Angeles. As a sub, projects that are overly pushy on equipment certifications and daily safety reports are the worst. tf are equipment certifications? Someone put this to music right now. Revolutionary safety shoes [deleted] When you\\'re two days away from retirement... This can‚Äôt be good for the machinery. How will they stop? Ya, I‚Äôm going to need to see a safe work procedure. Looks like he‚Äôs using the rig as a push pole. We were just talking about safety in class today, and my instructor puts extreme stress on the importance of safety because and making sure the driver makes eye contact with you because if you don\\'t and you just running around the job site and not watching what you or others are doing, some terrible shit could happen. Lucky he didn\\'t get knocked out cold he had time to move too... Had to push someone out of the way of a telehandler from this exact situation one time.  Dude acted like I saved his life at the time I didn‚Äôt really understand how big of a deal it was when it happened I feel bad for the operator as well. The operator had responsibility in this situation, however I bet the person felt like a piece of shit after this incident. I guess they both learned something the hard way. This one happened so easily.  Not many good places to be in that exact instant.  I\\'m pretty careful around the equipment, but this reminds me to be even more careful. Gotta say that he was in the wrong spot there. That being said, if you\\'re driving a loader full of shit you might want to be on the lookout. 50/50 fault Way back, just out of high school, something like this happened to my buddy at a mill - he got knocked down by a [skidder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skidderdualfunction.jpg) and it rolled over/up his body starting at his feet, and it was just at his head before someone saw and got the driver to go forward off of him.  He lived, but he was all messed up for quite some time as you would imagine, even lost one of his eyes in the mishap. When i am operating equipment on a jobsite, I am constantly doing head counts to be sure I know where all my guys are. The force from the stop doesn‚Äôt break the teeth. The dado stack rotated and the teeth from one blade strike the teeth of the adjacent blade. Carbide is very brittle. Like an airbag deploying in a car, this is also expensive to repair once activated, but a small price to pay when you still have all fingers in place. And they sue anyone who tries to introduce similar safety devices.  It\\'s like the 3 point seat belt. Objectively a safe device that should be in every vehicle. Volvo patented it and recognizing its benefit to humanity they opened up the patent for other car manufacturers. Not asking Sawstop to give it away like Volvo did, but at least licensing it would be beneficial to all consumers. I didn\\'t realise it wrecked the blade, I knew about the brake mechanism though This guys going to have to use his miter saw for precision hot dog cutting in the future. It\\'s the only way to appease the picky 5 year old when making Kraft dinner with hot dogs casserole. Amazing technology on a really well designed and built saw. I used a cabinet version in a shop a few times and it was as nice as the delta or powermatic we also had. Just have to remember to bypass the sensor if you‚Äôre using some sopping wet PT lumber. Fingers saved. Shrapnel blinds user üò¨ Why would you dado a hot dog though? So how does the break work, do you have to release something or can this thing separate wood from salami? Why does the blade suddenly stop? Take my fingers but not the shirt. You should try that with your penis. My woodshop teacher in high school did this demo with us a few times. Crazy shit! It throws a block of aluminum into it and stops it cold. Everytime saw stop comes up I think the same thing: Safety gadgetry is neat, but nothing replaces safe shop practices. After a 5 minute tutorial on safe table saw usage no one should ever be in danger of hurting themselves.     TLDR; don\\'t put your soft bits near the spinny stuff morons. The teeth broke because the brake squeezes the blade, or in this case blades, together. Most of the time the blade does not take any damage, just your ears from the gunshot sound of the brake being engaged. you are a day early MURICAAAAA WE DONT WAIT!!!! PARTY A WEEK STRAIGHT!!!!! Fly that bad boy. I thought these cranes looked familiar then I saw providence park lol. OP you and me worked across the street from each other while you took thisüòÇ this is why I love Reddit lol Today is the 3rd MERICA. FUCK YEAH. Happy 4thmas eve In SF or some other city? Omg reallyüòÇ gotta be safe for the people who make good. We did a really cool epoxy system for their kitchens. So freaking greasy but it turned out awesome Don\\'t offend 90% of Reddit readers. That flag could be symbol of hate. Knew I would trigger some people. ü¶Ö Why was this necessary? Cyclic loading deteriorating the bridge faster than originally expected without a midspan support (material fatigue)? that the west Seattle bridge? Heheh, too soon? this was 9 years ago, here you can see my \"handywork\" https://goo.gl/maps/kYHaN8GAHVanHWjUA   https://goo.gl/maps/WnKnvbt9EEJNXGGBA https://i.imgur.com/yomShHk.jpg  so thats the tensors we set up to avoid the V from opening plus a 1M  extra fundarion  reinforced with  carbon Fiber, now hodden with bushes Yes, while it was in the water. I did 3 columns on 2 different bents.  Last year, we had a tropical storm come through my area. A barge company usually gets notified 4 hours in advance before a lake upstream releases the dam. This time, they called and said it was already released. The barge company had no time to secure their barges (this is the story I heard)  What resulted was a barge drifting down stream while daisy chained to another and colliding with one bent. Another barge broke loose and hit another bent.    [Here](https://imgur.com/a/y0IOidE) is why I had to repair/replace the columns.   I‚Äôll get the finished product off of my work phone tomorrow. Dang it, I really wanted this to be a time lapse of the repairs. Looks good man. someone has to fix those fuck ups and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs someone with the diverse experience that it takes to put in a quality/safe product. offfff... amazed Who pours concrete from the top down. AKA Engineers on acid. Wow. The criminality of this industry. Just when I think it\\'s gonna be impossible to be more frustrated by humans, some sly fuck screws a city out of a functional bridge. Smell that? That\\'s the sweet miasma of corruption and selfishness. That looks like a ‚Äúfun‚Äù job,  these kind of emergency works pay better too, did the remaining colums hold while you worked, or did you have to lift the superstructure afterwards? Das ist gutes Zeug. [deleted] \"I\\'m sorry...we\\'re running into some problems, and this will take MUCH much longer than we anticipated\" Looks stunning! Where is it? Amazing Best part of these are usually avoiding the taxes Not in Philadelphia you don‚Äôt Had a couple of beachside jobs in San Diego. Definitely a nice little perk If you hadn\\'t included your plank in the video, I would have called BS..... Man, I\\'m looking at the forecast for the next week and I want with every fiber of my being to tell you to fuck off.  But I won\\'t, because that might ruin your view, and that view is gorgeous as helllllll. Any jobs going mate? Amazing view!! But wearing my bags and working my ass off all day in that kind of hot humid climate sounds more like a nightmare than Paradise to me. A lifeline with a safety belt would be recommended for a job like that. This is literally every day in Florida. Huh, strange. This has never happened to me. Idiot or genius? Atleast he had his hardhat on. r/osha He knocked out a human sized hole so the ceiling could safely collapse around him. Genius. Safety third! wow... I need this, the mortar of my ceiling is coming down. Need to replace all of it. Any ideas? Haha  you could still read it couldn‚Äôt you?  Everyone always overthinking shit. I do masonry for a living been around it all my life my name is mason my dads a mason grandpa was and great grandpa. You all are some pussies man. Bolster skills right there gentlemenüëå I\\'m going to show this to my guys when I show up to site, and none of them are wearing their fucking safety glasses. I prefer a face shield for metal grinding or cutting.  Damn.  After seeing stuff like this, people should realize they need to wear *more* than just safety glasses.  That shrapnel was less than an inch away from skin.  Throw the full face shield on too.   I love PPE ‚ù§ And that‚Äôs why we make sure our glasses are Z87 rated at a minimum. If this was a pair of gas station sunglasses, that lens would have shattered and his eye would be toast.  Pooped em Your supposed to wear a face shield when using a grinder People at my job just make sure to squint.  What brand of wheel? Man, I fucking hate cutting wheels. I always try to wear a full face if I can, and I always let the tool do it\\'s thing instead of forcing it. But those fucking thing shatter all the time. Had one that broke and shot up and stuck in a wood beam on my shop ceiling. Every time I\\'d see someone using it with out the shield I\\'d ask them what the fuck they are doing and point up at the cieling. It was usually a new person. Damn I am literally about to use metal cutting 4 1/2 inch grinder.  I am definitely wearing glasses and gloves.  Crazy you would have for sure lost an eye if not for glasses. We had Hilton buy one of our aging hotels in my small hometown for a remodel.  Every other hotel is privately owned.  When the job started, random tradesmen would show up to do work.  There were cases where the general was paying cash for these dudes doing journeymen work.  When Hilton caught wind of it, they built a plywood retaining wall arund the entire property and hired security guards 24/7.  Entering the site was like entering a military base on lockdown.  A buddy of mines whos a delivery driver said they searched and checked off invoices to make sure everything was accounted for.  On the way out, they checked to make sure you werent taking material off property. So how did this happen? use safe work practices and you have nothing to worry about Whenever I\\'m using a metal wheel (particularly thin cutting) I break out the face shield...  Would the \"play\" in the face shield (It can move as a whole closer to my face) make a difference in the penetration depth of the shrapnel?   I can imagine the \"play\" in the shield absorbing a fair % of the kinetic force particularly because I\\'d the area spread. Therebye decreasing the force available to penetrate...  (Think shooting an arrow at a loosely hanging peice of leather compared to a piece with backing)   Or am I completely wrong... yeah I don\\'r fuck with cutoff blades.  I\\'ve had them come apart on me too many times.  I believe people with imperfect eyesight are at an advantage over those of us with 2020 because they will always be wearing glasses, most of which offer some protection over none at all.  My advice is to buy some nice acrylic transition lens glasses that you\\'d be comfortable wearing all the time.  Why transition lenses?  because every time you take off your goggles to put on sunglasses, (like say on break) you are at a risk of losing your safety glasses and/or not putting them back on when you get back to work, or are otherwise in a situation that is too dark for sunglasses while working. Plot twist his glasses were in his breast pocket,, Wheel was aiming for that horrible chin hair  He wasn‚Äôt he had his glasses on lol This is why osha exists  I get that this happens but I am kind of doubtful on this one.   I find it pretty hard to believe that the fragment wouldn‚Äôt deflect off of the glasses since they are convex. That plus they would show signs of cracking from the impact. I just don‚Äôt think a grinding wheel is sharp enough to puncture treated plastic at an angle like that.   I would be he ground the glasses out and stuck the piece in there.   I‚Äôll put my cheesy dad-joke hat on and see if any of these meet your needs...  ‚ÄúLook out Pardner! Construction Area!‚Äù  ‚ÄúSorry for our BIG mess! Because, well TEXAS...‚Äù  ‚ÄúWatch your boots! No Bull!‚Äù  ‚ÄúYour Boots May Be For Walkin, But Do It Elsewhere... CONSTRUCTION ZONE‚Äù  ‚ÄúWatch out for rattle snakes, building shakes, and sharp rakes...‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo Entry! Violators Will Be SHOT ON SITE!‚Äù  Oh, and anything about armadillos! üòÄ For No Smoking signs:  \"No Butt Sucking\" \"suit & ties prohibited\"  \"All shoes subject to hammer test\" -hammer & toebox of boot graphic-  \"Fashion police notice: Highlighter colors only.\"  \"Tresspassers will be fined 1 round of coffee for the crew\"  \"We wish we could go faster too\"  \"Hardhats protect all the boys in the yard. so please, don\\'t forget yours\".  \"Please don\\'t feed or antagonize workers\" I am working on signage and want to do something with a little humor that doesn‚Äôt cross the lime of unprofessional- job site is an office building in Dallas where we are tearing up the parking lot to build out a restaurant pad site-    Anyone have any good ideas or suggestions?    Thanks so much, y‚Äôall !!! Please be respectful on site. No catcalls of our workers Also- All the mandated and necessary safety, notification, and way finding signage is up- this would be purely for good humor and fun- My boss said that Rome job would have been done sooner if he had been the foreman. So a large majority of our work comes from rehabbing assisted living facilities. Our superintendent is now responsible for taking the temperature of every laborer or subcontractor that walks onto the property each and every day I\\'d be curious what the procedure for taking the temp is.   It\\'s not like any of us has (or at least 99% of us) have any kind of training in infection control when it comes to cleaning a thermometer.  If it were me, I\\'d just be aiming my laser temp gauge in the general direction of the dude\\'s mouth. Make sure you fill out your name so you can be blamed if something happens!! Didn\\'t they say that 80% of people didn\\'t show any symptoms? How much medical training did they give you? As someone in HR, yikes.  I hope your company got their HR and Legal teams together to prepare for when this eventually goes to court.  Everything I\\'ve read says that if a pandemic were officially declared, this would be suitable, but until then this is the huge legal risk. Where u working at? I‚Äôm really glad we don‚Äôt work for the local hospitals or on their properties anymore. Wow, I hadn‚Äôt even thought of that requirement from a client. What about the flu? Also does your company supply vacation/sick days or health insurance? We get vacation days we can use as sick days and we have company health insurance. My foreman got tested today, came to work on monday after a skiing trip to Austria and didn\\'t feel well the stupid fuck.  Atleast two weeks paid leave isn\\'t the worst that could happen ; ). Hahahahaha. That sucks. Everyone is going to hate you. Apprentice friend of mine on a hospital job going through the same thing all last week and for the foreseeable future That‚Äôs pretty hardcore but I understand, the diversity of people on my job is vast but we haven‚Äôt gone to that extreme yet. The owner of a skilled care facility rehab project we are working on is requiring something similar. Sounds like a pain to manage from a field side. I also work for a GC that does a lot of senior living/hospital work. There are rumors that this is going to be happening for us soon as well. Where are you located if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? I tried to call out of work two weeks ago because of flu-like symptoms.  My boss was like ‚ÄúAwh damn dude ‚Äî I mean, I‚Äôve been sick too man and *im* still here, sooooo I mean like your not going to be in trouble but we‚Äôre pouring concrete today man we need the help‚Äù. So I went in and reluctantly ran the chute for 25 fuckin yards.    I have never felt so fucking sick and tired than when I got home after that shit.    TLDR:  my company doesn‚Äôt give a god damn if u have coronavirus u better be there or u can go work at Wendy‚Äôs. No doubt my project gets shut down soon. The school told all the kids to go home this weekend for the rest of the semester.  Where is this happening? Please. Too bad by the time you\\'re noticing symptoms you\\'ve already spread the disease Sheesh... I definitely sympathize with the guy who has to now manage this additional paperwork with all the other stuff. Laborers and journeyman can\\'t complain to much as it\\'s only 5 minutes out of they day, which safety meetings take as long if not longer. Wtf. World going insane They are starting to screen people for the hospital i work in as a contract plumber.. i feel sorry for you, so assuming one of these guys are sick, we\\'ll have to assume you are too! Godspeed my friend Oh wow, you got a medical degree AND work in construction?!  Cause I mean ...only doctors can decide who is healthy enough to go to work...right? Make sure you give them all a proper hand shake too First step of creating an official looking company form: use Microsoft Word default font. Tried ones, was fired from that morgue Safety orientation stickers mean a lot to me. They\\'re not actual souvenirs, but I\\'m proud of all of them on my hardhat. I‚Äôve got a stack of milk crates in my basement with old ass bottles, bricks with local defunct company names on them, a bunch of different rock specimens, horseshoes... hmmm what else have we dug up. Railroad spikes galore, there‚Äôs a ton of old trainyards around here.   We‚Äôve found trucks and tractors that farmers have burned and buried decades ago, but I didn‚Äôt toss those in the back of my truck to take home. Haha.   As for other stuff like cores, if it‚Äôs a particularly clean core, I‚Äôll cut and grind it, polish it, seal it, and bam! Paperweights for Christmas gifts to different contractors. Haha   Oh shit, almost forgot. My fianc√© reminded me of job I did at an old distillery. We were sawcutting out parts of the slab to put new plumbing in, and one section fell through to a hollow. There was a wooden footlocker buried that had rotted through full of prohibition-era booze. That was so fucking cool.   And my dude had a ceiling collapse on him in a restoration project. After brushing the plaster and dust off him, he looked down and saw bits of a skeleton, screamed at the top of his lungs and bolted out of the building. Haha. Building got shut down for the day by police, turned out to be a medical reconstruction or whatever. So I think he‚Äôs found the coolest shit: a literal human skeleton. Haha The guy who I apprenticed under, would take panties from the homes we were in.....weirdo Parking tickets, mostly. Yeah but nothing that big haha. I\\'ve taken home cool hardware or free tools from each job I\\'ve been on You must repair bridges, me too Not on purpose, but every time I switch to a newer vehicle I clean out the old one and find all kinds of them.   \"That piece of siding is from the daycare where I accidentally taught the kids bad words\"  \"There\\'s a piece of trim from the bathroom where the homeowner wanted the paint to be the same color as the green rock\"  \"Oops. That\\'s the hammer tacker D was looking for last week!\" I keep marbles, or bearings...sounds weird, but damn every job i do, i find a marble, or something similar to one I kept a broken off tooth from a geo pier rig. Too bad it looks like a giant metal dildo on my desk.  Nice collection.. cores have cool aggregate..  I scored a solid lead water pipe last month off a demo- rebuild we‚Äôre on in NYC I have a piece of granite brick that got sawed through during an urban job, they hit some very old walk and foundation as they started removals for a widened road.  Would\\'ve kept a piece of the streetcar rail they dug up on a lakeside project if I could\\'ve gotten a piece small enough, that line was built in 1887.  Aside from that, just the occasional bit of aggregate that\\'s particularly interesting one way or another. I cut dyed cylinders and make coasters out of them After I polish them up a bit. I have a collection of hard hats. I keep cores too!! I used to keep permit cards as kind of a running kill display. Thought core samples always looked pretty cool. All the tools I can manage to sneak out I have some sections of the Baltimore light rail, about an inch thick, that I use as book ends. Ahhhhh, that looks like some nice 58/28. Perhaps 19mm stone there? I used to keep excess paint, my old boss would always over order paint for jobsites. So I got to paint my whole apartment for free, and later the new house we moved into. I used to save cores. My ex wife hated it.  Had to chuck em out. Hey I saved the concrete cores for the electrical pipes that were taken from the foundation on the house we are building. I have no idea what to do with them I just figured this was probably the last house I\\'m going to build for myself so I kept them. When I was in commercial I used to get a ton of material that I installed at home. Stickers too for sure. Nowadays not really, but cool things always arise once in a while Yep. All kinds of crazy ones sitting around the office. Yeah every week I save some of their money What\\'s up with those cores being so dark? Never seen unpigmented concrete so dark Only old newspapers or Coke bottles. Why didn\\'t the bucket raise from the ground  Clean site is a safe site Shop brooms work best when pulling them.  Asked a laborer to sweep a stair tower a few years ago.  He started at the bottom.    That was his last day. Wait what\\'s wrong with his brooming? I\\'m not going to tell him he\\'s doing it wrong.  He\\'s from Krypton, that\\'s how they work the brooms there. They will find ways to label all construction as \"essential\" because construction = good economy. Don\\'t expect the higher ups to take care of us. WE have to take care of each other on the job site and most importantly look after yourself. Forgot to mention we have about 50 people on site I‚Äôm sitting here right now thinking how pointless it is as a construction worker to try to keep the virus off my hands when working.   I touch so many different surfaces and I am in areas where so many people have been I feel like I would go through a gallon a day.   At this point I have sadly resolved myself to the fact that I will get it while working. Our site shut down for quarantine. Normally for other people it‚Äôs 14 days. For our site it was three. But don‚Äôt worry they brought in 4 extra wash stations. Take that corona. All the office people are home though. Wouldn‚Äôt want them to have to slum it like us blue collars We call those pink eye dispensers :-/ We started building our own with small hot water heaters and a basin. We‚Äôve set up about 30 throughout the Bay Area. Not a hard solution and all the materials are readily available at HD. I came here to say thank you for all the hard work that you guys do.  Please stay safe and healthy. Just ordered 2 of those and 2 hand sanitizer stations for my project with no more than 3 small crews working at a time. Hopefully we are good My GC took the bag of sanitizer rrom our biffy for his personal use. Cannot wait for our governor to declare a stay at home. [removed] if anything,.dont touch your face Just piss on your hands, the ammonia in urine is a better sanitizer anyway. I\\'m in charge of a site with 20+- crew non union. I spray the restrooms and commonly touched surfaces 3 times daily with a 10% sodium hypochlorite solution daily. I check all personnel daily for fevers. I have also personally invested in face shields for the labors who jump in the trenches with close contact. This is utter bullshit that others are not taking these precautions. We are blessed to work and we have to protect our subs, vendors, and our employees. Figuring this virus lives a very long time on plastic.   This is a horrible device that should be taken away. Building a data center for hospital, they‚Äôre making us wear masks and stay at least 6ft apart, how tf are two guys supposed to do that on a skyjack lmao, and I‚Äôd wear a damn mask if I could find them, sold out everywhere. Hell me and my buddy even had to get temp checked this morning, we weren‚Äôt even working in the main building, this shits so dumb We dont even have a handwashing station and I\\'m in NYS. fuck the GC and the company which owns the building. I\\'m sure they could get one, they are too fucking lazy. ü§¨ Most likely there are already 5 million people infected in the US since January. Where‚Äôs your job? I‚Äôll take it. We had to rig a water cooler to operate by pedal. Actually works fairly proficiently. I did add an additional toilet. We aren‚Äôt running many guys but I wanted to make sure we never ran out of sanitizer, and the companies won‚Äôt sell you them separate right now. I always put a sliver of a chlorine tablet in ours ;) I was just at an maintenance outage for a paper mill with thousands of workers and the hand washing station I went to ran out of hand sanitizer or soap so they put out body wash to use instead GC here. We will be getting hand washing stations at our site soon due to people stealing hand sanitizer in the porta johns. Also our porta johns servicing company is no longer able to receive any more hand sanitizer from their distributer..   Any suggestions for good hand washing stations?? I had all my sites plumb in a laundry sink and ordered motion faucets The governments can be stupid cause they have no clue that your average jobsite are filthy and unsanitary. But what do they know there heads up each other\\'s asses in the office. Am I missing something?  I mean... for 50 guys you should have more than one probably... but if it\\'s kept stocked with soap and towels and there\\'s a trashcan nearby... what\\'s the problem? You guys need to give up on this mandatory and possibly paid two weeks off shit.  It‚Äôs never going to happen.  I mean fuck, Jefe wants us back by Easter.  Now the management is just going to want us to work on Easter too.  Just give up on the whole ‚Äúhaving time off to enjoy your life‚Äù thing lmao. This is at the north end of a bridge.  The setback from the onramp reduces its footprint.  Once it‚Äôs high enough, the setback doesn‚Äôt apply anymore That\\'s an architectural marvel. Amazing. I have an irrational fear of cantilevers. I couldn‚Äôt go up there. This is a BIG project, right?   If I recall correctly, this is the angle that makes it look the most unsupported. I love this, this is the kinda stuff i want to work on Can you send me more pictures? I\\'m really interested in this. This is in Vancouver? That is the dumbest fucking building I\\'ve ever seen, mostly because of the fact that it\\'s built in an area that is due for a 9.0+ earthquake any day now. This is a death trap. Who the hell approved this?! Does this have a core or exoskeleton? You should see some of the suites... It‚Äôs like they stole the design for TELUS Sky and flipped it on its top. Looks like Cookie Monster got hungry. Pushing the boundaries on psychological comfort Is something like this earthquake safe? It looks cool but it‚Äôs also sort of unsettling in a strange way. My brain seems to not like things that don‚Äôt seem sturdy (although I‚Äôm sure it is). Any idea how much a normal room would cost? AmazedüôÇ Fuck that I like it Tell us more about how you cut it. Jesus christ that could flatten someone. I trust you guys were safe, I\\'m just saying hot damn. that mud blast has to sting. your coworker wasn\\'t ready for it lol Now you have a nice patio to go with the window. That\\'s pretty freakin\\' sweet What‚Äôs gonna go in the hole? Is that a skate ramp? The man appears really small for some reason How long did it take to cut it with a 4‚Äô steel bar? Dude on the inside\\'s not named [Stanley](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.llworldtour.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F04%2Fflatstanley-book.gif&f=1&nofb=1) by any chance is he ? What kept the concrete from falling back on the worker? Why not a diamond, rope saw? my ears hurt watching this. wear earplugs guys Ceeeeaaaaaaaaassssssssaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought he was going to dab How did you move that out of there? They\\'re just un-earthing a Steely Mammoth. Pretty rare but global warming is thawing them out. [deleted] I\\'d like to see the sequence of works that goes into the recovery. Hope nobody was hurt and the driver escaped safely. Any chance of an update? Looks cold. Oooh, damn.  Did they get the machine out of the hole before it froze?   My dad and brother got their D8 Cat stuck in a slough in one of their fields in the middle of the winter. They made the mistake of letting it sit there overnight.  They tried using 5 tractors to get it out.  Nope.  It was frozen solid until spring.  However, that doesn\\'t match the one that my husband\\'s cousin got involved in.  You might have heard of it, since his buddy wrote a [song](https://youtu.be/QCcWzLAcv4o) about it.  Shaddy will never live it down. Fuck Drag it out and wash it off. Hopefully the seat heater is ok! If should be fine. Just yank it out with a bigger excavator and let it dry out. Just put it in rice The things he needs to get that thing out are in this picture. Got my scag stuck in a hole the other day, thought I had it bad.  What kind of damage is to be expected after this? Would the engine pull in all that mud? Hopefully the friend in the back can pull it out. I hope he got that damage waiver How much does it cost to rent one of those for the time at the job site? Hopefully they got the upgraded insurance package üò¨ A few people should be fired over this. How ridiculous. Hope everyone‚Äôs okay. yup, looks like a bad day O dang  Record the rescue!  I hope y‚Äôall get it out without having to call in some serious military grade rescue equipment. TheGreatWar.png Halp One time we had a contractor get a  dozen stuck in the swamp, we left it over night and when returned the next day it had sank up to the roof. Mistakes were made... At first glance it looked stuck in concrete. Any chance this is a mortenson site? I say blame the geotech (assuming you had one). Let\\'s be real, the pic was clearly staged. Everyone knows that management doesn\\'t check jobs in bad weather.... You\\'ll freeze before you make it to the first Porta John.  I miss working outside, so you guys/gals can stuff it.  My labia was warm and not sticking to anything. I\\'m laughing in Montana with 9 inches, at least I\\'m not in Bozeman.  *laughs in South Florida* Brick layers are in desperate need in ottawa. Labour too Ugh. Got 12\" here in Virginia today. Gonna have to go in early and shovel off the sidewalks and lay some sand down so the subs don\\'t bitch about it being unsafe. That and so they don\\'t carry in 20# of snow each because none of them give a shit about anything.  Spent last winter framing in the mountains in Utah, spending this winter as a super. My truck is warm and me likey.... Hah, its only 52 in Houston. Inside a home with the heat on. My subs are loving it. We are all in short sleeves. But damn if that porta can isn\\'t 20 below inside.   I\\'m on an inside job w/heat until spring ...... and then the AC comes on for the balance of the job. [deleted] Looks a hell of a lot funner than the 8\" concrete wall slabs we cut out of a 12 story building for balconies..... with active train tracks on either side. That part is fun, but everything before that isn\\'t On a side note I LOVE scissor lifts.  I‚Äôm a construction manager and I had never driven one before and needed one for a last minute job before handover. I was able to borrow one but there was no one qualified to drive it so I took a risk.  So much fun. Bricklayer here: when you tip those over, try not to rock it. Just push and keep pushing, otherwise it may come down on your side and being on a scissor lift with 3 people is not gonna end well if that happens. Have fun, but be safe! Really fun...until the cleanup. Unless you have a heavy machine to clean up. In that case WICKED fun!!! Great work! What amazes me is that the steel reinforcement extends only a few inches onto the bricks. Is this normal? I did this on a whole slate on an old house we rehabilitated ,  we had to cut 1sqm  at a time, and lower it with chains [https://imgur.com/a/KsEIDts](https://imgur.com/a/KsEIDts) What\\'s more fun is doing it manually This seems very safe Bro you might want to invest in this   https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/DCM501Z Highly flammable compressed gas in a small enclosed environment with limited ventilation, what could go wrong? The law says no phone while driving... doesn\\'t say shit about making coffee! Props bro!  Your my kinda fella!  I‚Äôll bring creamer and more coffee! How about just do this on the tailgate when you pull up to the job site instead of bathing in CO? What could possible go wrong with that!? üòÜ Y\\'all are being unreasonable.... OP is the site safety man. Forgot to ask, is that an old percolator? Looks like it\\'s well broken in. I was convinced I had walked into r/idiotsincars Well this will surely only improve the smell of that pickup I work for a telecommunications company and one of our divisions does prewires for apartment buildings. One of the techs on that crew does just this for cooking all his meals and his coffee, he just does it on the tailgate instead of the cab. Try the yellow tank. Makita makes a decent battery powered coffee maker Makita makes a cordless one....about the only good makita Jesus Christ. You remind me of my brother, the guy who insists on throwing gas on fires and barbecuing in our small enclosed porch. Oh calm down lads. That‚Äôs badass. Pouring concrete in 91 degree heat. Fuck anything hot today. You guys all need fo fucking relax a little, jesus christ for some reason i find these tiny, speedy men fascinating and wish we had video of the whole thing I‚Äôm impressed that it‚Äôs going directly on to the truck.  Nice efficiency there No rails or harness. It\\'s why A frame is outdated. There\\'s not many safe ways to erect/dismantle. Like ants.   We just use skid pans and cranes. Crazy how many pieces it is I‚Äôll try to make a longer time lapse when they take down the other side. r/gifsthatendtoosoon No harness PPE?  Fuck that shit. Scaffolding is kind of fun to work with. Read title, clicked without checking if /r/Construction or /r/CatastrophicFailure  Had great suspense.  Was not disappoint. I did this job for a couple years in twenties, was pretty fun. I got really fit from doing it, along with hitting the gym.   If you get on an awesome crew you can get stuff done fast. Pretty impressive. I like the guy who shows up at the end in the window, and is like: yup they are still working.. It\\'s kind of like watching ants work. Haha cool video thanks for sharing! I am really glad I don\\'t have to walk on that shit very often. /r/OSHA As long as the sings are up we are protected. I just threw a 20 litre container in the car for personal water, hand sanitizer, soap in a bottle, gloves, respirator, overalls.   One of those things you might want to get into if you don\\'t do it already is to strip down outside the house at the end of the day and jump straight into the shower, it is all good being clean as you can on site but if we are dragging it back into our homes at the end of the day mitigating the risk is just an exercise in compliance rather than treating it like the risk it actually is. My favourite is, ‚ÄúOk guys, everyone sign the covid sheet saying your not sick.‚Äù And then 10 guys pass around a piece of paper and a pen to sign it Call OSHA dude. There are guidelines. If the contractors can\\'t cant abide by them, they don\\'t need the project done. \"Oh look, we\\'ll use this puddle over here\"  \"Oh, you guys have water bottles right?\"  \"We\\'ll provide you with one hand sanitizer to share between the twelve of you. Use it sparingly!\" It‚Äôs JEDunn. What do you expect Our company went out and secured supply of 4x 5 liter alcohol based hand sanitizers for all our sites (around 30), and then realized they don‚Äôt have the foamy dispenser thing to make it work with the special tubs. They are on back order for another 6 weeks, thus why they were able to secure the refill cartridges.... I am a structural PM.  We are currently working for a GC that is providing multiple hand wash stations, installed hand sanitizer stations at all job and lunch trailers, limiting one persons to a vehicle or lift and checking all coming to the site in the morning for anyone with a fever, cough, runny nose. Stay Home if your not healthy.  Everyone is serious about physical distancing. If we can follow some simple things and really follow our local health departments, I think we can all keep working in an industry we all love to be working in. I can just imagine the bravado on site.  Just wait a few weeks when everyone around starts getting infected. Wont be long till the sites stut down. On the only big construction site I was ever on, the entire safety program, which appeared vast, was merely a lawsuit mitigation program. This doesn\\'t surprise me in the least. (I realize my experience is by no means necessarily the norm. I went out today to get small hand soap bottles from Ollies to put on each truck.  Will probably get a 3-5 gallon cooler per truck and fill them every day for hand wash stations. 100% gloves, 100% of the time brah We are not disposable. We have the same signs on our jobsites. I had to put up about 50 of them...C.Y.A. purposes. For guys using the sign in sheet, what I\\'m doing is getting the foreman of each crew to fill it out with their guy\\'s info on it then having them send me a picture of it to add to the electronic daily. That way only 1 guy is touching it.   I feel for you guys that are currently vertical and inside. Not sure I\\'d care to stick around in those conditions. Fuckin Je Dunn.. üòÇüòÇ You must have taken a pic at one of my sites. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen water at a construction site That\\'s always a problem. I work for a telecom company and we have done several jobs pre-wiring apartment buildings. One of the techs carries a jerry can of water in his truck for washing his hands. I think if I was in the field I\\'d do the same thing. I don\\'t understand how can a work site not have places for people to wash hands, they must have toilets on site for people to use right? Job site I left yesterday had a shelf nailed to the outside of the building, with a bottle of softsoap and no water, with the words \"sanitary station\" written in sharpie.  That\\'s all it took to meet the guidelines for \"safe work practices\" in the state of MA. We build Lighting and Data systems for Highways in Virginia. We‚Äôre still working and glad to have the work. We have 30+ crews in Northern Va and Southern Va  maybe 5 crews. Bring your own water and food to work and bring and attitude of gratefulness for being able to work another week and earn a living for our families. True. We‚Äôve never seen this before.we get 40 cases of bottled water a wk and good ppe. I don‚Äôt think we can fool ourselves about exposer. I get undressed in my garage and leave my gear in my service truck. I have 2 kids at home an my wife. I have 4 wks vacation but unemployment won‚Äôt cover my salary. If it goes another2 months it‚Äôll be a radical change for this country I‚Äôm afraid. It\\'s called a stand pipe for a reason Their are dark corners of our infrastructure where no lift can get under and no ladder can reach.  You‚Äôre welcome. I appreciate the man in the corner just staring at the wall. He\\'s already put himself in a time out. He knows what he did. I‚Äôm on a county jail job right now where our scope is to install firestop spray at the top of 10,000 lf of interior CMU. The only problem is that all HVAC is already installed. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to fit up there. At least his chain is latched Come on over to /r/osha I don\\'t know which part of this picture I hate more, the HVAC guy on the ~~fire sprinkler~~ pipe or the oblivious pinch point guy. Progress is progress yo You\\'re not my mom, I do what I want! Hate to say it, but I‚Äôve been there lol &#x200B;  What happened when you approached and confronted the chap with your recommendation that ya\\'ll shall all agree not to do this? Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. He has enough shit there to grab on to for balance.  I\\'d be more concerned about the fella squeezing between the mewp and the wall. That could be messy if the mewp moves. Agreed, squeezing between the wall and a lift is dangerous. Not the worst violation I\\'ve seen. Should have a harness on though. While there\\'s not really a clear path to fall through to the ground, shit happens. Of course there\\'s probably nothing approved to tie off to above him or around him. What trade is this clown? That is a cast iron dwv no-hub pipe. One extra once of weight over it\\'s PSI capacity would snap that pipe like a twig and this guy will be a victim of gravitational forces... Ha agree to which the idiot standing on the pipe above the lift or the other idiot about to get crushed with the scissor....ok I\\'ll agree to both lmao where is safety dave when you need him Guys that take pictures like this have never worked in the field and it shows. Too late, someone already did it.  This has now become SOP Is this polident job at gsk? Creeped out by the albino fella on the left haha It‚Äôs got a few hangers on it, not seeing the problem here^^ Nothing to see here, the safety chain is latched. Oh man that\\'s like the entirety of my job. I\\'m 5\\'3\" AKA perfectly sized to use the lift enough to then climb the ductwork and sprinkler pipes and various other trades stuff like a monkey. Ok I will never stand facing a corner doing nothing. I don‚Äôt get how the dude is gonna get crushed. Does it look like the guy in the lift can get the controls quickly. Plus knowing the said idiot I‚Äôm sure he made eye contact and asked to pass by. Not saying the metalcraft dude isn‚Äôt retarded though because they are terrible to work with and probably would come down without a warning. Why not just raise the lift up? Separates the boys from the men [deleted] At times I will do stupid shit like this. I weigh about 130lbs. So I can get away with this from time to time. At least he wasn\\'t standing on PEX or PVC. His choices were bad, but at the same time good. He knowest the hangers was right there, so any experienced worker knows that those hangers can support some weight. Still, a bad idea. Lmao! I mean- technically he is probably not 5‚Äô above the lower lever(deck of scissor). Not gonna try to argue that one with osha. God I hope those welds don‚Äôt hold up. Some ppl unfortunately have to learn the hard way Nah if you\\'re a contractor all you have to do is load it however you want and then slap the side and say \"she\\'ll ride.\" At least that\\'s how my boss does it... Don\\'t tow with a Mustang. Got it. If you ever get in a situation hammer down baby and pull the trailer straight This happened to me, all you have to do is get what you\\'re towing to collide into the side of your vehicle like a real jack knife and it\\'ll correct back to normal no problem. A sway control system really helps too. Every driver that plans on using any size trailer should have to learn this.. One contractor i knew would overload his trailer and would block up the leaf springs with wood blocks so it would still roll, totally safe right? Problem is here in SoCal, as elsewhere im sure, lots of contractors are using 1/2 ton trucks and pulling trailers with pallets of bricks, concrete,  tile, dirt, small equipment,  lumber and the load it neutral because their trucks cant take the weight. That‚Äôs common knowledge... don‚Äôt put all the weight on the tongue or the back of the trailer, spread it as even as possible. Do people just not know about weight distributing hitches or do they not care? Ship my pants? Safety Guy Protocol: 1. See hazard. 2. Take picture 3. Say nothing to foreman/Supt 4. Turn photo in to office and let the shit roll downhill.  All while Supt stands at the bottom of the hill continuously eating pile after pile of shit. I\\'ve honestly never had a safety guy like that. All the GC\\'s we work with have safety guys that basically make you fix it on the spot or they wont leave. Super chill about it though. They have no problems passing out fresh safety glasses or gloves which is pretty awesome. Ya\\'ll need better safety people. Borderline negligence that will get someone hurt or killed. They all care more about surface level compliance than actual safety. And usually the safety man is doing something unsafe while he\\'s taking a picture of you doing something unsafe. I  I had a safety guy call me once because one of my guys was on top of something and was not tied off. One of my guys then sends me a picture of the safety guy on top of something higher than they were, so he could take the picture of them and you could see he wasn\\'t even tied off himself. Safety people need to respect the chain of command, but they\\'re also inspectors. Unless it\\'s an immediate hazard, they should follow the chain of command. If they do insert themselves in the field and in the moment, they should address the foreman unless there\\'s an imminent threat to life and limb. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an unsafe method‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you recommend changing?‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy insurance doesn‚Äôt allow me to instruct you.‚Äù The site I‚Äôm on has diesel excavators running indoors with no ventilation and plenty of masonry dust floating around but I get yelled at for taking my safety glasses off to land wires in outlets As a safety I guy i take a picture, point it out to the foreman to fix it or take the time to fix it my self. Load it into our company‚Äôs software to document to prevent it from happening again. If it‚Äôs imminent danger you stop the work. Most of the time nobody gets upset. You‚Äôd get fired taking a photo and not doing anything where I work. My safety folks will shut you down if you so much as fart upwind from them. on sites i have worked on if you arent there the day they choose the site safety super for the workers that is now your job.   always hated having to go around with the ministry and the developers safety person though cause then i would have to go around and tell all the trades to fix their shit or we will get shut down.   amazing how fast people disappear when the ministry shows up God laborers truly can find a way to fuck up literally anything I laughed so hard I hate to say it but this has happened to me. Felt like I pinched my dick off.  I did not report it as an injury. Literally laughing out loud. Just wait until you get the workman‚Äôs comp paperwork. Hahahahahaha Worst game of ‚Äújust the tip‚Äù ever! Should have had him fill out ‚Äúwhat would have prevented the injury?‚Äù Haha My company sends out a quarterly safety bulletin and publishes accidents/injuries and lessons learned. I would love nothing more than to see this in there. I know I‚Äôm unpopular here but this is the exact reason I stand to wipe my ass Shouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äúwipping‚Äù his own ass to begin with. ...soooo I‚Äôm a contractor and my own toilet seat is just clipped on to the previous screws because I‚Äôm lazy and when I have guests over I have to warn them of this possibility. Sometimes, I hear a loud as crash and ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù from the bathroom and I chuckle to myself. That‚Äôs fucking amazing hahaha Hell yeah that\\'s a real injury I bet that hurt! Am I the only one that holds my junk away from the toilet when taking a dump in public? Even when I wipe I keep my hand down. It\\'s difficult but worth it. My uncles a welder and his jobsite doesn\\'t cover cost for \"useless appendages\" in other words your penis That‚Äôs a new All site safety/toolbox talk meeting topic. ‚ÄúKeeping your dick tip safe while in the portajon‚Äù There\\'s a workmans comp claim that id like to see. r/funny Have only had to use it once. Thought it was so sweet. My super wanted to use one for everything after that haha Not the crane - but the spider lift work platforms - as an arborist we get called occasionally for trees that cant be felled, are too unsafe to climb, in locations that are not accessible to a traditional bucket truck, or are tall enough that a 60\\' bucket truck isnt sufficient.  I absolutely love them.  They increase productivity, and when used properly, increase safety massively. No and that‚Äôs badass I never even knew they existed haha No but seen them in sf. Theyd shake the whole building so bad when they moved youd have to reset all the lasers, laying out youd just have to wait till they moved. Badass watching them though Several of these machines can fit through a standard door way. Very cool machines. Havnt gotten a job running them yet tho We use something similar for Glasswork. Mini crane with powered suction cups for hoisting big heavy panes of glass. Quite a handy machine Wtf is this witchcraft???? Saw one for the first time about a month ago. Didn\\'t know what it was called, but thought that it would be prudent to call it a spider crane due to its looks despite only having 4 legs. I\\'m a bit surprised to read all of these comments.  I work in commercial construction and these units are always on the job for ironworkers and glaziers.  Get the right tools to make your job safe. If you can\\'t lift something, a machine can. I used one with a basket on the end for me. They are cool. Some painting jobs you need em. Is this job in L.A.? Cool crane. Never seen one like that. Seems really versatile.   BTW that‚Äôs a crazy bump in the cable tray. Im curious what this was used for? Like what inside of a building is so heavy you need this for? It doesn‚Äôt look like it has a bunch of counterweight. Is it limited in reach/capacity? Seen a few of these around on some taller buildings, along with the Jecko. I think that\\'s what they are called. It\\'s a mini crane like the Spyder but the outriggers are different,  heavier boom. Used a bigger one of these to install a monumental stair late in a project in FL.  Really cool and 100x easier than chainfalling all the pieces. Spider cranes and spider lifts are one of the ultimate tools, I get to use the lifts pretty regularly. I used one to set beams in elevator shafts on a job a couple of years ago. They‚Äôre good machines and easy to move around into tight spots. I‚Äôm getting one delivered to my site next Tuesday. Pretty stoked, not gunna lie Cool. More than I expected. There‚Äôs a mom joke in there somewhere. [What the hell is even that](https://youtu.be/J_zr-Qk6wh0) I was on a job recently were the iron workers were using one. It looked like it would be fun to operate. DOC OC Yeah but not to go 10‚Äô Not the crane but the [concrete pump versions ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LkyQHmdaDGNo9ht692u-2POlfnI-fB1AwFziIpbnkgrVZssNWbgrUxT1mMNNoKTIy4ySWLfYhDRRQSBFXR95EtjeXMNDKw00QmYEXR_fmyeGq3GDhF3MceoUt88U7EmwccdORAZ2yBBvI1KYXcwDWuQUGubQrbu-fFWEi88tMfNF-vB3LoTt7qnQUWbdVXk16u0nvKUhaa-Qsn_tNBiIxui_kK2Q) a lot. Ones getting dropped off at the job next week, in fact. Yup, used these for jumping exterior columns, and setting curtain wall Yeah, use it to hang curtainwall. That looks fun! We\\'ve had Brokk machines out for concrete demo before but never had a mini crane robot. Yes! I have to admit I didn‚Äôt know what it was when I was told, ‚Äúa spider crane will be on site‚Äù but my imagination brought me to pretty much what it was. Great name, explains exactly what this badass thing is! Is the a spider droid from Star Wars? The separatists entered the chat lol https://imgur.com/a/jhyeE2q/  https://imgur.com/a/HDvI6HY/  When you receive a crate of special order glazing units, and the shipping company forgets about gravity. They will fit in a shipping container, just. that\\'s a pretty big one, they work great!  &#x200B;  Here is ours at my project. installing a tower crane on an existing building, had to bring spyder crane up the freight elevator, that brought up our derrick piece by piece and then the derrick crane brought up our tower crane piece by piece. Pics of course!  &#x200B;  [https://imgur.com/a/beZpeUU](https://imgur.com/a/beZpeUU) I\\'ve never seen one before, that looks pretty awesome I was slightly disappointed to see that it has tracks. For a minute I thought it could walk and I was super excited. What‚Äôs this used for? Anyone know the certification requirements for running one of these?   Do you have the certified like you would to run a fucking crawler crane and have an NCCCO or CIC or is there some type of exception for this device?  I know that cranes with less than 2k capacity do not require a cert and that is how mechanics can run the cranes on the back of their trucks but this is 5k so I‚Äôm curious. Seen that once when the building was tiny. Used it to install an automated car stacker. I‚Äôve used on a previous hotel job in Times Square.  For curtain wall installation. Great if you don‚Äôt have room for a tower or mobile crane.  We did not need a master rigger on-site while this was in use. I am actually going to use one for the concrete superstructure of an out of ground apt. Building. They will leave out a rectangle in the floor above so they bring this up to the next level. Then the hole gets filled in. It will be used to bring rebar and formwork from ground up to current floor! Crane Spider Level 90     Drops PPE (+70 def, 15 pierce resist) and 5x Scrap Metal Spider Crane, Spider Crane, works well in the sun or rain  Fits through doors, stairways, too. Lifts up boards, or just a screw  Look out, here comes the spider crane YouTube strikes again. That‚Äôs a no for me dog. Those are some nice temp stairs You need at least 1 more stringer if not 2 depending on the width. You need to close the risers off with something, new code says they can‚Äôt be over 4‚Äù gaps anymore. Stairs that wide should have 3 stringers. Railing? Also you def need a 3rd stringer. And 2x2s?? I feel like you have a lawsuit/homeowner insurance claim on your hands waiting to happen So no permit? Because if I had to inspect those stairs they\\'d fail. Oof That cantilevered landing on top looks sketchy :-/ Everything about this is rough.  Sorry for your loss bro. Yikes this cant be OPs project gotta be swiped from the internet. Sometimes I can\\'t tell if people posting things here are serious or if they\\'re mocking something they see nonprofessionals do.  This one is good. And I consider looking at post history cheating. Is that a 2x4 post lagged to the beam?!! While we‚Äôre at it..... looks like the beams are carriage bolted to the post and not bearing directly on them. Also looks like the joist cantilever exceeds allowable span, especially considering the stringers are bearing their load on the cantilevered portion.   OP- Google AWC deck guide. It is an awesome resource on the proper building codes for deck construction.   We all sounds like dicks, but it‚Äôs better we all come off as assholes, then someone getting hurt. *Please Read in Full!!!* If a home insurance adjuster ever has to come to your house, this will disqualify you from ANY AND ALL PAYOUTS. A deck and stairs built like that, without permits, is grounds for immediately dismissal of any insurance case!  Speaking as a former carpenter and a current construction PM, do NOT keep those stairs in the long term. You have nails or screws holding the weight of every stair. No stringer straps on the landings. Not even an L brace for the upper set of stairs The top of the upper stringers doesn\\'t have any nail plates connect it to the deck, which I can tell without being shown that you don\\'t have lag bolts into your house.  The short version is, absolutely NOTHING you have built is built to code. The reason we have code is do you don\\'t kill people, not for permit $. NOTHING on that is structural.  I mean this in the nicest way possible, but that is a death trap. It is ungodly dangerous and you should take it down. No exaggeration. It won\\'t come down today, or tomorrow. But, in 2 years when that wood is starting to rot because you screwed right into the end grain making any sort of sealing you do pointless. When that wood starts to rot your screws are going to become loose. It will take one person slipping on a set of stairs and catching themselves to knock a stair loose. Also IT DOESN\\'T HAVE RAILS OF ANY KIND. WTF?! You\\'re working 10\\' off the ground without rails.  If you were on my jobsite, I would kick you off and get into my force majeure clauses. If you plan on selling your house within 10 years, you will be passing that death trap onto an unwitting party. I swear I\\'m not trying to be an internet asshole, I\\'m just trying to save someone from breaking a leg or worse. Looks like a nice project, but probably in need of a bit of adjustment to be safe.  What do your footings look like up close? The one that I can see on the right appears to have potential issues with water retention As mentioned above, shits fucked yo Is it normal in the US to put a wooden pole directly into concrete? In Germany you have to use post support shoes. So water on the ground can not be soaked up by the wood. My dude, you made one of the biggest mistakes a DIYer can make on reddit...you posted pictures of a deck you built. I\\'m a licensed GC in the NE and I\\'m gunna shot straight with you. These look nice, but other than that they are not great.  1) That span needs AT LEAST 3 stringers.  2) The stringers need to be cut so the treads rest on them. The 2x2\\'s will 100% come loose over time and will most certainly cause an injury when someone inevitably falls through.  3) Current code (in most of the US) says that you cant have more than a 4\" open gap on any stair riser. They don\\'t need to be 100% covered, just not able to let a 4\" sphere pas through it. This is to prevent people and kids from falling through or getting stuck.  4) The third joist after the top of the stairs is only half sitting on the beam.  5) The 2nd floor deck looks to be cantilevered out past the 4x4 post more than 2\\'. This is a big no-no.  You should put another post from the end of that cantilever to support that corner.  6) It might be an optical illusion, but the rise of the top step on the first landing looks to be less than 4 inches or so. Minimum rise on a set of stairs is 4\", but the maximum difference between riser heights on any set of stairs is 3/8\". Please use /r/homeimprovement or /r/DIY u/ClassroomDecorum  TYL not to post DIY projects in this sub.  YouTube is a BAD source for learning how to do something.  Your local/state building code probably isn‚Äôt very difficult to read, and online access should be free.  That should be your #1 source for this type of project.  Good luck with your stair rebuild Is it me or are the top set spaced further than the ones below the landing? Like more than 1/4‚Äù different? I absolutely love when people post DIY stairs on this sub , Yall are so funny 5 or 10 years down the line one of those 2*2\\'s are going to give out and  injure someone badly if you don\\'t inspect it regularly These are what we call treehouse stairs. I‚Äôd be adding another support where the 2 stairs meet in the middle. Handrails would be cool as well. As mentioned,the 2x2 tread supports are also a concern. So many things are off with this Safety man‚Äôs concern is going to be the missing fire extinguisher They probably would have been able to stay if they had the proper ppe. But in all seriousness if someone came to my place of work and started making my life harder or taking my tools they can eat a dick. I mean it may depend on the job lol but Im not gonna sit there and let it happen, even if I know they have a reason to be upset. Your mad at cops, not me bud so take that shit somewhere else. The backstory here is this is my split shift crew from 11am-8pm at San Jose Towers  I got a call from my foreman right as this was about to happen. He said protesters were trying to break in where we don‚Äôt have k-rail supporting the fence on East Santa Clara across from City Hall(this is a delivery zone for the window wall). I told him not to confront and get off the site as quickly as possible. At that point there was a lot of shouting and that‚Äôs where this video picks up. The protestors went for my guys tool bags and various pieces of lumber around the site as well as a fire extinguisher. I‚Äôm not sure what was said to get the protestors to move back but they did quickly as seen in the video. I‚Äôve had multiple requests from the owner of the project to our corporate leadership back in Boston to share my foreman‚Äôs phone number.   The reality is our employees lives are on the line daily working in heavy construction, whether or not if they agree with the content of the protests these guys went above their job description to protect their place of work.   I‚Äôm down here this morning thanking them in person. I am sorry but the guy in the helicopter reporting is a dumbass. Seems like some cooler heads prevailed and they are walking away. No you dumbass the guys in the hi-vis jackets are construction workers yelling at the idiots to get off their job. Journalism at it\\'s worse right here We, as construction workers, are typically very prideful people who take great joy in seeing our competed projects around town. Not many of them (us) are just going to stand around and watch our hard work get destroyed. Has nothing to do with justice or injustice but, rather having pride in ones self and doing what is right. Is it right how the police handled the GF incident? No. Is it right to destroy someone else‚Äôs property and hard work? No.  Just be better. Get the rosebud! These aren‚Äôt protestors, these are looters. Last I checked, Ghandi didn‚Äôt go around trying to loot everything.   I hope they get things back under control soon though. Amazing bravery on the part of those construction workers. Even the police aren‚Äôt willing to face the crowd. I guess y‚Äôall forgot how many riots it took to get union/workers rights. Hand out job applications, the streets would clear in minutes. They did these guys a favor stopping them. There is nothing but danger for anyone fucking around a site like that. They ain\\'t protestors. They\\'re rioters. Fuck them. We construction people have a lots of shit already going, which we handle by ourselves Bunch of losers Cops killing people is what gave us our 5 day work week, 40 hour work weeks, and the benefits we have. Solidarity with them bc god knows cops dont do shit for us. There\\'s are not protesters, these are rioters and domestic terrorist.  They are not protesting shit.  Fuck people like this. I wouldn‚Äôt fuck with hardworking construction workers Disgusting Awesome! And you all know this is the most exciting news out of Downtown San Jose all year ‚ÄúIf you want to sign up for the union please line up 6ft apart and we can get the paperwork started. Tradesmen and women of all types need.‚Äù   (People start running out)  ‚ÄúCome back we offer good money and benefits‚Äù Fucking scum bags Good job guys! Fuck those looters and terrorists [removed] Id shoot them with a hilti gun Good for those workers. Those weak degenerate assholes would\\'ve been turned back immediately at my site. Too many well fed, hard motherfuckers with no love for losers there. We should just shoot all the looters until they release that hero cop Really incredible. That is a ton of steel and concrete Doing one of these in Boston right now. 50ish panels, deepest one is ~140 feet. Good luck! Wow whoever rigged that is a true professional. Holly shit boys. Good on ya. Keep on killing it and be safe. üëäüèæüëçüèΩ Embeds already on nice I love the Engineering that goes in every Construction projects, specially Construction of this magnitude! 32 corners seems like a lot. Were the adjacent landowners unwilling to sell? I know work like this is not easy. But what is the general day-to-day of this kind of large scale commercial construction.   What are the hours and days on/off.  Skill level required. Any other additional info you might throw my way. This is the type of work that makes me feel like my job isn\\'t real construction.  I\\'m always working inside buildings, half the time already finished.  This shit looks pretty intimidating to me.  How long\\'s it take a green guy to catch up and be useful on a site like this? Madonne, grew up in the tri-state area so it was a little easy to become desensitized to all the development that goes on out here-  but whenever I see posts here of what goes into projects of such a scale/scope it blows my mind.   Kind of gives ya a fresh appreciation for all the crazy development that goes on around here. That\\'s incredible. Please post more pictures of this job. Sweet.  Location? What is a slurry wall? Slurry wall? Not concrete? Does something like that get tied on the gound then lifted You got to have a great deal of respect for these people. Literally any second they could have died. Dangerous, yet noble work. You were right.  Construction looked so much different back then. No welding, power tools, osha, etc. Nothing but respect for those that came before us. This makes my butthole quiver Its water under the bridge. Base on looney tunes  physics they should be fine. Where OSHA got its name. The last thing you heard from a guy falling ‚Äú Oh shiiiiiiiiiitttt........‚Äù I love watching old time construction work videos. So crazy to see how times have changed. OSHA approved [deleted] Nope. Not a single safety harness in sight. Brave souls indeed. Those men have balls of steel Man that looks like Deception Pass on Whidbey Island. Fucking straight bad ass dudes in this video though. fuckin ironworkers still work like this if you aren\\'t up their ass about tying off These guys are chillen because they have never seen final destination r/osha These were men, what a generation. There\\'s a net under them. r/sweatypalms This whole pandemic really just confirms what alot of people already know about the people that sign their checks, I think. Speaking from my perspective, non-union skilled laborer/ assistant superintendent for a gc doing everything I can to get the experience to move into a superintendent position and run jobs on my own. The owner of my company \"cares about everything going on\" but she\\'s breathing down my neck to meet an impossible deadline. And her reasoning? \"It will make us look good\". I hate it, I absolutely want to tell all the subs on the job that they deserve better, and to refuse to work in the conditions our company is forcing them in. But I know it\\'s not going to change anything,  they have kids at home they have to feed. And if they take my advice then someone who doesn\\'t care will just take their place and they would be stuck jobless to just to prevent something that might happen to them.   I know I\\'m not going to be with this company forever but I really feel like now wouldn\\'t be a good time to start a job search. So like others I feel like I\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard place. Props to this guy, almost every site I\\'ve worked on has been seriously lacking in hygiene stations and general cleanliness. This guy is right.  Construction companies want essential work to continue so they can keep the checks coming.  For anyone looking to send something to their higher ups, feel free to copy and paste:     Most employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around...   Since a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum:   1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment) 2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces  3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.) 4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other. 5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. 6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)  I assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.  The first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.    To conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.    This is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. All the Hispanic workers are like, \"que?\" I can really resonate with this dude. My situation is a bit different where I work for a small residential GC and we\\'re doing remodels and new construction on people\\'s homes. My state just released an order yesterday that says as of midnight tomorrow, we are to stay at home unless of course we are considered essential, which it is outlined that construction trades are.  I don\\'t work with large groups of people but I find myself running to stores a lot for work equipment and supplies, I deliver them to houses where we have trades working and touching everything, and I\\'d be lying if I said I didn\\'t feel a little uncomfortable doing so in times like this where in this area we are watching the number of covid cases creep up.   I just had my first child at the end of January. She is two months old today. Her mom hasn\\'t gone back to work and most likely will not since it doesn\\'t make sense for her to keep working service jobs to pay for daycare, and with restaurants being closed for weeks now she wouldn\\'t be working anyway. I\\'m the sole provider for the home life I\\'ve built and I don\\'t want to go to work for fear that I\\'m going to bring this shit home to my family. We are healthy so far but anxious beyond belief. I can\\'t help but google what goes on every day and listen to public radio to hear about the latest developments. While to some extent we are essential that we need to wrap up people\\'s homes for them to prevent fucking up their closing dates or to board up their homes to be safe from the elements, it\\'s hard to stay motivated when I\\'m as worried as I am.  I have the most mixed feelings about what is to come. Great that I have a job and still working, I\\'m luckier than most until I wonder if I really am or not when I\\'d rather be safe at home. I don\\'t want to worry anymore if I\\'m going to get my wife and baby sick by trying to provide for them. As someone that runs multi million dollar projects as a GC, this virus has been a detriment to employee morale. We‚Äôve gone to provide as much social distancing measures as possible, proper PPE, and sanitizer stations everywhere. Despite the precautions, workers continue to be very worried.   I‚Äôm worried too and I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. When you know just what your company knows, it feels awful knowing if one of your guys gets it, it could put the entire crew at risk. If you get sick at work, you\\'re eligible for workers comp. When employers, and more importantly, workers, realize this then jobs will get shut down. Most everyone on my crew isn\\'t worried about getting severely ill from the coronavirus, they\\'re worried about taking it home and getting their wives, children, or parents severely ill Is this guys company doing their part? It‚Äôs real easy to point the finger at the GC but the GC also doesn‚Äôt have to provide him his PPE either. There‚Äôs a line of company responsibility by his employer as well.   Granted some GC are in fact just shy of worthless with respect to the general health and welfare of the workers, but the context here is unclear.   If only guys like this were as passionate about pulling a broom behind them as they go. I love how he steps right on tripping hazard he probably left behind on his way down from his soapbox. I set aside a little bit of that anger for the fucking Communist Party of China who also owns Reddit.     Those fuckers are ground zero almost every single flu.  I think there should be consequences.  We\\'ve all been making them rich for so long now. literally had the same meeting yesterday. All workers have the right to a safe and healthy workplace and also have the right to refuse unsafe work. All precautions should be in place and no one is expected to put themselves at risk.  However, this guy is another union blowhard who is only interested in stirring up shit to get more memberships. Not productive. Oh look canadians giving up. I\\'d assume they are French canadians This is awful.  The handwriting is legible and you labeled the actual wires instead of using some cheap labels that will fall off or marking them on a separate sheet according to some arbitrary, out-of-sequence numbering system. Where are the burn marks and the randomly protruding screws you use to secure the box loosely to the Sheetrock?   Somebody‚Äôs going to not electrocute themselves with this kind of work. Looks good. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different, those 100% perfect panels you see posted take hours to complete. Yours is good, clean, safe, legal and properly organized. Some might argue to put black before read but w/e. That white wire needs to be colored black so you know its hot. 240 2 Pole should be red or black. How are you powering the future from a residential sized service??? Looking good brother! That‚Äôs your company‚Äôs advertising right there! Wow I don\\'t know you\\'re getting compliments. If I were to make up a panel that sloppy, the rest of my crew would never let me live it down.  Also why are you wires crossed over each other? I know it\\'s residential but come on have some craftsmanship If one of my apprentices made this up id make them redo it. Sorry.  The tub appears to be upside down  Wires should be numbered. What they are should be on the panel schedule.  Why is there a neutral in a 2 pull 30?  A and B phase are flipped. And if  you were to keep it like that then wires on 10/12 need to be flipped to be consistent with phasing. Or just reverse the phases and fix 2/4.  Wire management should be better. Not bad for first time, but definite room for improvement. Why is there a random neutral traveling all the way down to the bottom left instead of landing on the top neutral bar with the rest? If it passed inspection and is easy to follow what does what it\\'s a decent panel I usually take off my labels for my final but now I‚Äôm rethinking that choice. üëç Looks good. I\\'d change the black and red wires but that\\'s it. Looks better than mine. Good job. Literally had to stare at what the labels were to make sure this wasn\\'t one of my pannels.  Your hand writing is exactly like mine and that\\'s about as clean as a panel that I have ever made. Where do  the future ones go to? Looks better than 95% of panels I‚Äôve come across.  The 5% is high end homes. Liking the \"jiffy\". May start to label them all like that myself. Anti oxidation gel on the aluminum mains? As carpenter that will one day look for a breaker to kill power I fucking love you. This is a great job Nice job there Don\\'t let this guy\\'s tell you it looks off. A functioning and legible panel is a good one.   People spend way to much time making it look \\'perfect\\' Is Noalox not required for those feeders? Or is it a small amount that it isn‚Äôt splooging out? Fuck that Who took the picture? Notice that they all have their safety harnesses on. What a photo! I can\\'t think of a better picture to take on a site...you win You hiring? Instant pins and needles! That size rock sucks to shovel. Have fun. Call Badger and start sucking we installed some drainage pipe for a community center, well we left some stub-ups so we could come back later and put in the actual drainage boxes. Come back the next week and our pipes won\\'t drain a single drop soooo we have to uncover it and re-run it per the superintendents request. We cut into it to tie in and the Entire 8\" of the pipe is filled with concrete. Come to find out when the concrete guys were done with their stuff they used our stub up as a washout and just poured the rest of the concrete down the hole. To this day I will never understand what possessed those people to think that was a valid way to dispose of it. Make him remove the rock Maybe he was trying to make it safer? Or was there guardrails around the hole? Hey, at least it wasn\\'t fresh concrete! To chunky for a vac truck ? Did he fill just the hole? There‚Äôs no rock next to it and it‚Äôs not entirely full. Looks like just the hole was filled. I shovel that rock almost every day...railroad ballast and it fuckin sucks. Much more aesthetically pleasing. How does one accidentally fill such a hole with rock?  They didn\\'t think \"hey this hole doesn\\'t look like the kind of hole that should have rock in it\"? How?   Why? oh fun! Time to jet and vac the manhole and all the lines. lol Guy at work forgot to barricade or put the top back on an unattended man hole and filled it 6‚Äô deep with rock. That‚Äôs a paddlin Gotta throw out the whole job site now I read 6‚Äù at first that did seem that bad.... So what kind of steaks are you gonna cook? Had a ex-supervisor now coordinator drill into sewer accidently and fill a few blocks full of bore crete. Only realised the issue when residents complained and never questioned why he was using cube after cube and not filling the hole. Wouldn\\'t a temporary plywood cover had sufficed? Nice! I just did a 20 hr drive to get home for Christmas (2 days ago)! It\\'s nice to walk away from the end of a project and be confident that your vacation won\\'t be interrupted for things you didn\\'t finish. Congrats, enjoy! Looks hell of a lot cleaner than any roof I\\'ve seen in New York lol. Jesus christ... 130pm sunset and a 25 hour commute. I really need to be more grateful my construction site is across the road from my house and I walk to work. Still getting that sweet sweet fuel allowance though! Where is that you\\'re working? That single ply membrane looks very loosely installed?  What membrane is it? I\\'m a roofing contracts manager in England  and have never seen a single ply membrane laid so loosely, so many baggy areas in that roof. Looks good. I‚Äôd love to roof in a place like that. from a roofer in the states have fun, roof on and don‚Äôt fall off. I would love to live here instead of New York Be safe on that drive!!! Boom! Enjoy ! What‚Äôs with the loose installation? Is that a typical installation? What type of roof is that pvc? You\\'re well on your way to being a professional capentern.  That is one clean framing site  Looks like some fine, straight walls.   Next time video your work, slow down a bit, give us time to appreciate your craft!  Petition to change apprentice carpenter to carp-intern invest in a good hammer, save your arms and shoulders.  Brotherhood for life! Good job brother! I‚Äôm guessing raised would floors? In our area by code we have to float any basement walls due to Bentonite causing the ground to heave if it is a cement floor on the ground.   Edit. Never mind. For some reason was thinking it was a basement finish. Job looks clean.  Are you in the northeast? Good job, now keep learning there until you can land a commercial gig. Why do you sound like a pug in heat? Looks awesome!! I\\'ve debated on joining the trade...I\\'ve always wanted to learn to build!  Good job guys :) Good on ya bub Welcome, little brother Great job, bud! Looks good bud. Take pride in your work and always be willing to learn from others and the trade will be good to you. Are those electrical boxes plastic? No idea that was a thing. What type of coating is that on the floor? God I cant even look at another residential job without getting nauseous. It looks good though bud, it\\'s a good start. Good on you. Bitchin Work safely !  Yes, it was getting really bad for me until we started back charging for it. We also started including in our bids for them to make sure they pick up their own personal trash and it has gotten better since. At least the water bottles are not full of pee.  Company used to have this issue, until we issued a worksite policy document to all subs that work with us. Now if they don\\'t clean up the site at the end of each work day they get fined $250.00 per offense. We always have trash bins on site and a dumpster on site where they can throw away debris. We also added a non smoking policy, as a lot of our remodel customers started to complain about the scent of cigarettes. Subs now have a designated smoking area that isn\\'t near the job.  Constantly. If you have a trash can available you have document and fine to slow it down. If you don‚Äôt have a place for the trash then get used to it.  I think part of it is being present as much as possible. As a job is winding down I will drop a offhand \"looks good so far, after you clean up make sure to send me your invoice\" and that gets the point across.  Also I don\\'t back charge I just hold the payment if it is bad. I try to control everything I can and make sure my in house people are extremely clean , if the jobsite is clean when a sub shows up they usually get the idea. I\\'ve always found electricians to be the worst about not cleaning up after finishing their rough ins. Of course this doesn\\'t apply to every electrician but the ones I\\'ve dealt with over the years seem to think they aren\\'t responsible for the mess they create.  We have a system called composite clean up. If a sub has anywhere from 1-10 guys, then they have to provide someone for (8) hours on Fridays to help clean up with all the subs. We have a sign in sheet, and if they don‚Äôt sign in then it‚Äôs a back charge at the rate of a laborer.  I\\'m doing punch lists for a building. There was one guy whose refrigerator broke down. Naturally, he stashed the entire contents of his old fridge into one of mine. A lot of guys had free lunch that day. Gc here- yes, subs are the garbage they leave behind. As most of the comments say- clean sites are a good indication of professionalism.  Those blue 55 gallon barrels make great cheap trash cans with the top cut off. Cheap fix Only everybody ever.  Construction workers are pigs, flat out, it‚Äôs very rare I get a crew that actually understands they are on someone else‚Äôs property, and that they represent their company.   You gotta rub their nose in it and keep track of them.   I had one company start writing conditions into job tenders for site cleanliness. Any contractor leaving materials not work related and the whole job is issued penalty on their work. It‚Äôs a bit heavy handed, but on those sites it seemed to work out well.  The absolute biggest kick in the juts is when you bring the trades coffees and then find the cups thrown everywhere. Drives me nuts. I will be implementing a clean up personal trash clause.  F that shit.   Edit In Toronto I was at a light facing a construction sight. I along with my dash cam witnessed guys walking up to sight flamboyantly tossing their truck garbage into sight as they walked towards the entrance.   If you‚Äôre building at Mt pleasant Lawrence across from intersection.... it was your foundation guys.  Every job I\\'ve ever worked in SoCal has looked like this.    Developer also has always had at least 3 laborers only working for him.  Their duties are sweeping and keeping the street gutters clean for SWPPP reasons, general trash clean up, sweeping all floors once a week and probably things I don\\'t know about.   I\\'ve never worked on small jobs though, just big tracks. This looks like my current house that is being built.  One day I had to take a piece of rotting cantaloupe out of the wall that they were about to close in with dry wall!  I just recently sent a picture to my builder where they were going to seal up coke cans, gatorade bottles, water bottles, and just general trash in my island.  I hope my builder reads this thread.  I sure dont blame him, but I wish there was a way to get control of the construction crew.  I know they dont care about that house, but I worked hard to earn the money to build this, and that is why they are earning money at their jobs.  I know its hard work, but dont put the trash in the walls in the house that I am going to live in.  Thats just mean! God yes. We (the GC) have spent literally $250,000+ on labor on my current project to clean up after our subs. Luckily all of our subs\\' contracts include \"progressive daily cleanup\", which they sure as hell didn\\'t do and we have the documentation to prove it, so we\\'ll be backcharging them for the entire amount.  C O M P O S I T E   C L E A N U P that\\'s what the gc\\'s laborers are for Lay a broom down on top of it These subs were probably hire for a cheap price. We would never ever leave a job like that. I guess that\\'s partially why we are considered \"expensive \"  No. Every sub on our site is immaculate and even sorts their own garbage, recycling and biodegradable items.   WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF QUESTIONS IS THIS?!?!?! OF COURSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM!!! WHO THE FUCK DOESN\\'T!!!??!  That\\'s pretty crap of them, since it\\'s so easy to throw things in a bin.  But don\\'t you guys have labourers? I mean, cleaning that up and keeping the site tidy is a job for them, keeps them busy. Proper housekeeping clean as you go. Danny Ramos. Never work with him. Broken wine bottles everywhere.  Omgosh yes!!! I had to go pick up the whole bridge job site yesterday, and I\\'m the only one that actually throws my shit away...I found water bottles literally a foot from the dumpster... seriously dudes?!? Oh the well Yep. Empty packs of cigarettes stuffed into empty bottles everytime. Just randomly bring the trash from your car and put it in theirs works great they will get pissed and request a different site or realize their jackasses and stop being dirty scans Always include specifics in the contract, including removal of job-related debris, tools, food wrappers, water bottles, and any other form of waste etc. They must fulfill all conditions within the contract to get paid.  This means if they don\\'t they have to go back just to pick up their litter if they want to be paid No trash can, not even an old box or a bucket on site is sometimes to blame Every single job. The one I\\'m on now is the worst I\\'ve ever dealt with. Regardless of the contractor they\\'re all slobs. We have 55gal trash cans scattered throughout the buildings, rolling tippys for the big stuff, forklift tippys for getting the trash to the dumpsters. The dumpsters are maybe 40\\' from the door and everyone has to pass them at break, lunch, and leaving for the end of the day when they walk back to their cars. We hound people daily, enforce the rule in their contract about composite cleanup crews and try everything possible. None of it works. The guys we\\'ve got are slobs, plain and simple.  How about pick up after yourself like a grown up or a decent human being.   Add in contract that the sub starting work is a condition of acceptance of the site condition.   If they accept a dirt workplace, they get to clean it up - along with their own mess - daily.   This forces the issue via he GC on the previous trade.   It works.  Charge them a fee for the clean up, that\\'s what my company does. Back charge all day, man  We get in so much shit for leaving anything around, especially garbage stuff. I mean, those water bottles deff were in a cooler etc, it‚Äôs easier to just put it back, or most new sites literally have recycling bags near the garbage.    My buddy use to say, we should just go round up the homeless people and get them to clean up all the cans an stuff.  Train them with safety an let them pick it up.  Guaranteed they‚Äôll be there every other day after work to get their cans lol  I know it‚Äôs not as easy but picking up after yourself seems like a far fetched idea  [deleted] Well done. Health is above money. A new meaning for DEAD LINE Being on a basket lift is about as good social distancing as you can get. So the carps and the painters huh? BAC is gonna be up on the wall till jesus calls it himself. Mason love baby, stay safe. Thought this was r/jokes for a minute. [deleted] [deleted] Can\\'t read. paywall Oh fuck they slaughtered your girlfriend. Those bastards. T\\'is merely a fleshwound! I don‚Äôt wanna post it but I got attacked by a power planer today...fingers nice and smooth now. Still at the hospital cause my boss made me go  Edit: Fuck it, don‚Äôt look if you gotta weak stomach https://imgur.com/a/9jlRJoH What got ya. How much paperwork? I hate to ask, but was the thumb just kinda hanging on after it happened? Superglue, duct tape, back to it. My foreman fell down the stairs today, so to fuck with him we painted a white body out line where he fell lol üëç Better than yours! ‚ÄúSorry sir I can‚Äôt piss for you I hold my dick with my left hand‚Äù Good luck thuming a lift like that Hope you heal soon brother! I\\'ll see your cut thumb, and raise you a [shredded elbow](https://ibb.co/G7QbTwm).  Ok, it didn\\'t happen onsite; it\\'s a road injury. I just wanted in on the body horror train (users posting injures) as it\\'s leaving the station. That looks like a serious ouchie bro. So whatchya do? Get well soon, sir. Sporty little Thursday Better than yours Step one working construction...Don\\'t let the damn thing kick your ass...\\'cause it will. Super drove his truck through our nearly finished Mitsubishi reno project... it was a great day of clean up! Broke my tibia climbing on the track of the excavator. ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Landscaper tore apart my power cord with a backhoe, a framer across the street fell of the second floor of a house, and my truck\\'s transmission is on its last leg.  But at least my hand is in-tact. Jesus dude. Ya skillsaw yourself? Exam day already? Workday was fine. Blew my tire on the way home. Speedy recovery my friend! Gloves Jesus christ I did osha 30 all day. Clearly the tile worker needs some more safety training Don‚Äôt know if gloves would have helped in this situation, but damn, pictures like these are why I have my gloves on as soon as I start working . Stay safe out there bros .üëçüèª Looks like rookie hands. Keep at it. Soon enough your calluses will have calluses. Now go dip your hands in some salty water and then dry them off with steel wool. You‚Äôll be good as new in the AM. Fuck that Cute little 66‚Äô parked next to me for scale. üòÇ My favorite thing about booms that high is when the boss comes and says ‚ÄúHey I need you to...‚Äù  Just boom up. All they way up and scream down ‚ÄúWHAT?!‚Äù Until he walks away. I didn\\'t know they went that high. What sort of work are you doing at 185\\'? I like the part where it feels like you\\'re sill swaying around when you\\'re trying to sleep. I was on a 135 fully extended when a huge gust of wind blew me away from the building then swung the basket through the window.   I was never scared of heights or anything until that moment.   I came down and talked to the PM for a bit explaining the incident when a dude came in hysterically going on about the guy who went through a window.   Like it really freaked the dude out You guys see the video of the guys lift tipping and they swing by their harnesses? Cray  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10213724371079351&id=1107750939&sfnsn=mo Nope no fucking way. I had to gag dens glass out of a 120 and that was sketchy enough.  Nope Nope....how are the pavers holding up?  I can‚Äôt even imagine, does that thing just swing all the fuck over the place?? *is a tower crane operator*  You don\\'t scare me. I dropped my side cutter, fml... I don\\'t care what the science says, nothing will ever make me feel a boom or scissor lift looks stable to me. When I see a fully extended boom lift, I see an industrial ceiling fan mounted with drywall anchors. I know that boom has a wide stance, but how can you get that high without some outriggers?     The highest I\\'ve been up to is around 80\\' or so. I don\\'t mind heights, I think ~180\\' would be fun.    Are you a bigger guy? I\\'m a small guy and all the big guys that I worked with didn\\'t like heights, so I always ended up in the basket, lol. I like how it jerks when you max out an extension and makes you think it\\'s about to drop your ass. You want me to go up there? Tie me off to the building otherwise FUCK OFF The sway though.  I\\'m not afraid of heights but I fucking hate the 185, Ive literally climbed all the flights of stairs on a heater and climbed out the steel rather then use it. Fucker has so many autoleveling safety features, hate it What\\'s the rental cost on that monstrosity? The 155\\' I used last summer was around $20k a month. Haven\\'t gotten to see a 185\\' in the wild yet. What trade are you in? And I get scared going full extension on a 40 footer! At least it‚Äôs almost straight up, hate seeing a spring board waiting to happen,  NOPE  How far can you boom out horizontally before the tires come off the ground?  Nice! Im often on 60s and 85s, but my company doesn\\'t do much work needing anything taller. I would love to operate one some day. Yikes! Very nicely done, sir. I was on the same lift, but only needed to go to 120. In fact, it would have been freaky to go any higher because there would have been nothing around lol Looks a lot like Oregon State University Now shake the basket back and forth wuss. r/sweatypalms  Neeeeeeeope Can that thing fit through a double door opening?  Electrical tape is part of every tradesman\\'s triage kit  Fucking stabbed through my hand one time, started bleeding everywhere, found some gauze and wrapped my hand like ten times with electrical tape and got back on my staging  I was cooking a few weeks ago and cut my finger while chopping, and by instinct I grabbed some paper towel and electrical tape and kept going. It\\'s nice to know some people understand, because my wife thinks I\\'m insane  True story. I got wrote up for a safety violation for not having my hi-vis vest on once. The reason I didn‚Äôt have it on?   An electrician almost got his arm cut completely off by a piece of glass the glaziers dropped from the third floor. I used my vest to pack the wound and wrapped his arm in stego-tape.   I feel bad for whoever had to remove the tape at the ER. Stego-tape might as well be fucking welded on once it sticks in 100* weather.  Only used when ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll stop bleeding‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work  ITT: compliance officer\\'s worst nightmare You see the problem here is that you‚Äôre not supposed to do that. Case closed. We righted it and did a thorough inspection but luckily the hoses and knuckle for the articulation had enough movement it was ok This is how you know your training program needs to be looked at. Closely. This is exactly what these haul trucks are designed for. Flop the body which is just a bunch of steel, and the cab stays upright which is where all fragile components are ( people,engine, electronics) are. Unless something lodges in the body, at which point the cab will flop and the body will stay up. So was this an articulated truck before the event?    (/s if needed) How much poo came out of him when this happened and when the boss got him? Good time to grease the U-Joints. When he asked where to dump you should\\'ve specified \" out the back of the truck\" r/wellthatsucks Jesus people this is literally what it‚Äôs supposed to do. It‚Äôs the safety feature to let the dump bed roll, notice the cab is  upright. Yes it sucks, but this is not at all uncommon. Ground personnel would be watching for this in most situations and steer clear of being near it.   I haven‚Äôt been on a crew that isn‚Äôt aware of it, every good foreman should make it clear, not just with this machine but all heavy equipment. I‚Äôm sure the young operator was shocked and a little shook up, but again...it‚Äôs designed for this and being in truly off-road conditions where this is more likely than we‚Äôd like it to be. Not enough common sense to operate heavy equipment. Your fault more than his to be honest. It\\'s dumped. that front end loader will get it back up no worries Lol seen it a ton    Why oh why is it always a wiggle wagon? A friend of mine was tasked to dig a massive crater on his first day. Didn\\'t know what it was for til his boss told him to dump a bunch of dead cows into the hole and to cover them. I‚Äôve done worse lol WTF ! Words to live by Holy balls, you‚Äôre really having yourself a day. Rolling a dump truck, burying a scissor lift, and redoing all your formwork! Maybe time to bag it. Ahh Dumper yoga   sexy Does it still work? What\\'s that, an 83\\' Volvo?    I leaned to drive a rock truck in the size up of this one, but the cab looks super familiar. union? Bad supe. I\\'m guessing it was also his last day in the truck? *last U fucked his wife didn\\'t you? You dog We had an inspector once who would walk into a disabled bathroom and sit on the grab rails.   If the plywood patrices weren‚Äôt installed we ended up with a floor full of broken wall tiles and plasterboard.  It only happened twice... Second the ‚ÄúWut?‚Äù  Why is the plywood covered in sheet metal? \\\\*cries in estimator I‚Äôve built a lot of commercial projects and I‚Äôve only seen this kind of armoured backing in the ‚Äúwet‚Äù cells of an airport border services facility. Is this just office space or somewhere special? Everybody gets to fight over this change order! Inspector ain‚Äôt paying. If the spec says the bathroom has to be ADA (and it almost always has to be) the estimator screwed the pooch if he didn‚Äôt put in for extra backing If you\\'re anything like the gcs we work with, you didnt plumb a stud or pull layout and it\\'ll all end up on the ground anyway Inspector prepping for the hulk to use this bathroom Is this for a bariatric washroom? lol Yeah kuz you know .. fatties Lol wut? I spent months doing just plywood backing all day errday, but I\\'ve never seen sheet metal on top like that. Stud manufacturers like Clarkdietrich limit the amount of perforations you can make in a given span.... that might‚Äôve exceeded the limit Fuck that! Is this a DSA project?  Probably a bigger deal that all of the stud are 20 Ga. Pro studs TBH. Is that a pvc plug in a cast iron clean out? As someone who used to install a lot of cabinets and other millwork, this blocking is God sent. That‚Äôs an overkill. What strikes me, is that you are allowed to leave a connection of a waterpipe inside the wall. This wouldn‚Äôt be allowed where I work. All connections have to be accessible. Did the inspector pay the change order? I\\'m a PE for a company that does public works construction in California, primarily schools. In my experience our Inspectors (DSA) don\\'t have authority to direct this kind of thing without a citing a specific code requirement. If they wanted to see something like this it would have to come from the engineer, in the form of a response to an RFI or some other field directive.  In other sectors or states can inspectors just decide they want something done a certain way without consulting an engineer?  Just tryna learn. Inspectors get a kick out of being massive infected schlongs  My favorite inspectors are the ones dealing with gas - it seems like literally every single gas inspector has his own set of rules and regulations that contradicts the others The last commercial job I ever did we had to put backing like this in 300 units because they wanted it to be ADA convertible   Fuck commercial Swiss cheesed that backing lol i‚Äôm surprise they didn‚Äôt make you put the middle truss screw into the flat stock lol What\\'s the purpose of all the screws? Dan\\'s backing for the win Reminds me of OSHPD. Fuck those guys. weird for an inspector to call on, but \"deadwood\" is really smart to put into bathrooms in general. Were the plans approved by the city or whoever issued the permit? Having installed many many grab bars with deficient backing, this is overkill but appreciated. That\\'ll be a bitch to change a leak Why metal? We used to use the metal strips for grab bars. This seem kind of over kill to me. A few jobs I was on had us use 1/4\" steel plates for the grab bars. That was also over kill.   I\\'m loving the cast iron. Thats how we roll in NYCü§ò It doesn‚Äôt matter what you use for backing as long as it holds the proper amount of weight. It‚Äôs easy to find those numbers for metal and wood. This is bs, the inspector is pissed about something and you guys didn‚Äôt call him on it. Plus In twenty years in Colorado I‚Äôve never had to inspect backing once, but it might be different elsewhere. A lot of jobs I‚Äôve done the backing is means and methods meaning we use whatever we want as long as it meets spec. Sounds like this guy has dropped a bit too much acid in his youth, how do mount anything without hitting a screw head? Wut This is why we qualify 2x8 instead for our multifamily units in stead of flat strap. Don\\'t have to worry about stud Guage or notching studs. Are you hanging safes on those walls? Rather this than a lawsuit years later for old mr.smith holding on to a weak shower bar r/skookum I am not feeling the love in these comments. I had an inspector like that  Wtf. But my book says [deleted] The plans had no detail for the backing in the washrooms? That\\'s crazy with the flat stock on top though, I\\'ve never seen that before. Some flat strap would\\'ve done the trick lol. Is seismic even a concern for the cabinets?? Change. Order. Did he decide that? Or is it in the spec? Why is the bathroom self leveled? Does it not get tile? \"Welp, time to go buy a sawzall.\"  -That dumbass So just the safety bar showed up to work today? That fucking chain brake saved his face/life, he should gold plate that piece and put diamonds in it! I\\'ve had that reaction a mnay times when I was mitering a pipe and the matabo decided it was done being a team player I never had a close call this bad, but a couple of times a year when I do have a close call that makes me realize I‚Äôm not focused, i wrap it up and go home for the day. Holy shit, what a way to go. I think r/OSHA would like to have a word, Sir. Time to change my shorts! Damn it Jerry!! Welp, I just went saw to head. Time for a beer . Playing 80‚Äôs music and thinking Scarface. Just use jigsaw Never stand behind the bar, for god sakes Yup fuck dat shit. r/whatcouldgowrong Dear God! Put that thing away and never use it again I had a 6‚Äù hole saw kick on my once and hit me in the face.  It stopped spinning right before it hit me or else I would look like me potato head right now. I definitely would have shipped my pants. I think the guy recording this wanted ol buddy to slice himself down the middle. Hahaha dude stepped down like \"here,you can have this thing. I am done for the day.\" Sitting at home right now cause of getting hit at work last week with a concrete chainsaw in the face. This almost made me sick. Not trying to say what the dude was trying to do was acceptable or safe...  But if he oriented the saw so it could cut from the \"bottom\" of the bar, he would have been fine. Is that Jerry from Parks and Rec? Wasn\\'t even wearing any PPE. Dude had zero brains. Holy shit! He almost cut his unibrow off OSHA wants to know your location r/WhyWereTheyFilming Man, you guys complain when we barely make it out to the jobsite, and then make fun of us when we do. Lol   &#x200B; In order;  Inspector, Site Manager, Crew Forman and Surveyor Quality control is really important being on both sides of this, those guys dont like it either. if they could, they would rather stay at the office or in the trailer, doing their work, and not dicking around on site being hated by everyone else.   And a 7th guy taking pictures to post on reddit. As a former union superintendent, this is tame. I\\'d been those laborers for years, it killed me to watch it happen. My crews loved catching pictures of me with the other white hats and sending them to me because they knew it bothered me.  My biggest dislike about unions is how I was not allowed to help labor anymore [deleted] I like that hi-vis rebar cap. Oh, wait. This isn\\'t r/OSHA That is nothing when I was a project engineer we had myself the Assistant project manager the superintendent, 2 manufacturers represenitives, the subcontractors projectmanager and the owner all watching 2 workers installing a rubber waterproofing on a elevator pit.    That is 8 people watching 2 people work if you lost count. I felt bad for them. Why so many people working?? Why does anybody feel bad about this?   It really sucks when people above you are incompetent, but that‚Äôs what I went to school for. So I can stand right there with those guys and not feel bad.  Or they‚Äôre working on design. A super to say what  can be done, a PE to RFI it, a pm and an engineer from the sub, or architects.  I can hear them now.  ‚ÄúWhy the hell are we three weeks behind schedule??!! Hey Jose, you sure you‚Äôve been working 12 hour days??!!‚Äù There are a lot of hurt feelings in this thread Could be a safety/quality control audit. To be fair, I went to school for 4 years and busted my ass as a laborer for many years before going to school. I get even more hate from the guys because I‚Äôm ‚Äúyoung‚Äù even though I‚Äôm not lol. I‚Äôve earned my spot as a clipboard warrior. At my last job there would be 3 or 4 of us plus the owner standing around watching 3 people work. I do get hands on though simply because I get bored or if I‚Äôm tired and want some activity. The Union summed up in one photo.  Hey, those CM student loans aint gonna pay for themselves.  [deleted] Now imagine 33 miles of 2 lane motorway at 50mph average speed check because one man is putting out cones while another man is picking up those same cones at the other end  Not typical in the UK. Supervisors are often having to do the work themselves due to cost cutting or labour shortage  And guess who gets paid more Real question is putting the block up there OSHA has entered the chat That‚Äôs pretty smuckin fart.  Solid as a rock!  I‚Äôm being genuine, by the way. Dawg it\\'s called a scissor lift There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this I‚Äôve been on tons of setups like that. This one time we were building a set of fire stairs in a 65‚Äô tall block wall shaft..that was some real sketchy shit. We had ladders clamped to the stair framing 4 stories up. We were tied off so no real worry but damn was that a rush being up there. OSHA has entered the chat This is why there are so many workplace accidents in the United States, hire a scissor lift and save a life. Are they going to need a scaffolding crew to change the bulb? 12awg can lights? Must be a big honking circuit unless they aren\\'t using LEDs. Pheeew, sweaty palms. Hope it all worked out! Thays legit... I think. üëç Seriously.... Dont knock it. How do you even.... You: Hey man, don\\'t knock it if it works. Am\\'arite?  OSHA:  Here\\'s yer sign you know its not that hard to build a wooden scaffold ‚ÄúGreen horn, climb out there and wire that light‚Äù Is it me, or is that light can at an angle and gonna light up that adjacent wall all day, instead of the living space below? How old is that ladder? We‚Äôve banned all aluminum ladders on site for years now. [deleted] Working for that compo claim!! OSHA wants to know your location [works just fine ](https://imgur.com/gallery/beCpaaB) Couldn\\'t you just use a lift? Maybe a Perry lift? I have 4 levels for this sort of thing. I dont get why the creativity for something thats safe and  designed by engineers that already exists isnt used more often on this sub from what I see. No. I won\\'t knock it for working, I will, however, knock it for flying in the face of OSHA. [deleted] That 2x rated for 600lbs? Cause if it fails, game ova. Wasting time building intricate scaffolding. If I was your boss, I‚Äôd fire you for this bullshit. He‚Äôs not wearing safety glasses! They said he had to tie off. They just never told him where.  Many times I felt like doing that on my job. WTF is that rebar even for? Are they really encasing that column in concrete? That\\'s, ugh, interesting.  I\\'d bet my paycheck this was taken on a Monday It\\'s cheaper because there\\'s no OSHA to slow things down or force you to spend money on nonsense like harnesses.  r/OSHA  foxcon construction worker Getting off while getting paid.... Somebody‚Äôs having a bad day. It isn\\'t bearing much load now.   I was working on a remodel of a lake house early in my career and we started removing some really pretty, 3/4\" thick Cypress siding from the interior walls. Got to where a steel beam carried across the entire length of the room in the basement (probably 30\\' span) carrying about half of the upstairs. We removed the piece of siding next to the piece that was under the beam and realized that the siding was all that was still holding the beam in place. Never seen a group of guys haul ass out of a house that fast in my life. Also never seen load bearing siding before or since that project. Damn your strong! Just disintegrating that shit! Well that makes no sense. Load should be on that concrete wall behind the studs. My advice is to never do termite work if possible Replace with metal studs and never deal with termites again! My friend had a rental property with a termite infestation, the only thing holding up the building was the lattice on the outside wall That‚Äôs a change order. Angry disappointed client who thought you were supposed to have x-ray vision. how is it still standing? Yeah, but there are plenty of factors that can make it hard to build. Yours is an awesome story, though, lol. Makes me want to wear a dust mask... or not. Got the Black Lung pops. How do you even fix this? Shit I physically cringed watching this. Florida?? satisfying to watch termites need to be moist to live.  Once the moisture is gone everything can be replaced one piece at a time.  You can also get treated lumber that is pest resistant. H I don\\'t see anything wrong That looks like it\\'s inside of a concrete wall, so I\\'m guessing the joists are not load bearing at all and that the concrete actually would be the load bearing wall. Am I missing something here? be careful, those splinters are load bearing! the load is on that concrete wall...are you not in a basement? Omg stop Termites are a huge problem in Charleston.  Certain neighborhoods theres damage in every home.  - i had someone working in an attic have the ceiling joists fall (thankfully in a corner only and got caught on the A frame ladder)  - i have had someone have a leg go through the subfloor in a kitchen during a demo remodel while we were doscussing the project.  Be safe!? I hate the port-a-toilets.  Do a jobsite safety meeting addressing this as a health hazard.  Explain in detail what should and should not go into it. Maybe 3 out of 100 guys on my site would actually read and understand this note Post it in Espa√±ol Lol one job in particular the portapotties were so bad. Like people pissing everywhere, shitting on top of seats, tp everywhere, etc. I get an email from the lead super intendant (I was a the tile pm) basically saying that he cannot believe it, but for the first time in his career he is shutting down the job and having a mandatory sitewide meeting about toilet training... I couldn\\'t stop laughing, and should have gone to the meeting. And also saved that email. He has one of those older supers who didn\\'t take any shit and chewed everyone out. Seen it all kind of guy. It\\'s worst in other parts of the world.  At a construction site, when you go to some parts of the building and find crumpled bags of cement, you cover your nose.  They seal up pipe for floor drains to keep workers from \"using\" it. I know when I was in California Hispanic workers would only throw tp in the trash...and if there was no trash they would throw them on the floor. A lot of times, it‚Äôs hispanic guys that do it because they think it‚Äôs going to clog up the drains. (Yes it‚Äôs a portapotty but they do it out of habit/not realizing)   All you have to do is make up some superstition or rumor about not putting toilet paper in the drain and they‚Äôll start doing it. I wrote \"Hey, have a great day\" to break from the usual I see, and someone replied \"Thx U 2\". Had a couple of serial garbage can pissers on a new construction tower at a hospital.  The laborer who had to clean the bathrooms on every floor left notes like this for a dozen floors. Hey that guy is a hero when you run out of tp! We had ppl intentionally stuffing the pisser with tp in phx.  Apparently it‚Äôs a joke the mexicans make that they think is funny for some reason haha I do that and I\\'m not Hispanic. It\\'s to clean up the piss on the floor before I drop my trousers in it to take a deuce. These comments about Hispanics thinking that port-a-shitters are piped in are ridiculous. A lot of those guys are way smarter than mouth breathing plumbers or iron workers I know. Somebody put a lot of thought into this Can confirm the water is mixed with bleach. This should have been a thing on all jobsites betore Coronavirus Props to whomever did this.  May not be the prettiest of things, but they are working on keeping the guys safe(r).  We can\\'t even find a biffy that still has sanitizer in it I like this, virus or not. Hi there, entry level Project Engineer for a GC here in the states and there are no hand washing stations left to rent in our area. Going to duplicate this set up this weekend for our guys. Even if it comes out of my $1200 stimulus check the gov is dishing out for people. Thanks for posting, this really means more than you know. All that work then you put the soap in a container you have to touch lol. How‚Äôs that on/off work? Better put in Spanish too Meanwhile, no paper in the shitter.. I like it, but you should only be hand washing in potable water. Not OSHA compliant unless it‚Äôs in Spanish too!!   (Buzzer) If you look closely you can see the safety chain... Attached to nothing. Oh man that\\'s going to be a TON of fun to explain and then pay for all the things they are going to say you messed up; from the water leaks they will surly blame you for years to come to the new sod they are getting.... Go get his check. I\\'ve seen fights over far less severe safety violations. Fuck that guy. What was dropped? Huh.. don\\'t see a problem here ¬Ø\\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Why does it have one short fork and one long one? Did a fork break? Lol not even fucking close This is my worst fear Everytime our one eyed, recovering crack addict operator gets in the lift. It\\'s just the angle that makes it look that way Big Loey! Leaned on the \\'fork down\\'  I\\'ve had my forks get stuck moving down slowly while dropping a beam 4 stories up, quickly turned off the machine and called the mechanic. More like the lol, amirite? Fuckin Murcia lol There I was. Somme, France, 1916. I found myself alone in a trench behind enemy lines. I had only my pvc glue grenades, not much, but the mess and vapors would be enough to dissuade at least a few Hun electricians from getting close. As the fog and the dark rolled in, I heard the jingling of side cutters and wire strippers and voices speaking a language I couldn‚Äôt understand. One of Ohms, supply and neutral. My heart sank, and I cursed Daylight savings time as I unscrewed the lids. Wow. Amazing shot. I dig it Is there a trench box just out of sight? Looks like a grave. Love the few weeks out of the year where I get to turn the lights on because I need them. Great shot here   And I‚Äôd love to see the look on the bosses face when one of you idiots said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going in there‚Äù üòÇ This is a damn good picture you filthy devil. Daylight savings is over. Dont blame it. Without it, the sun would set pretty early all year. Ah we are going to need a banana for scale. Looks like 12,000 lb mini ex likely has 24‚Äù bucket so at most the trench is twice the width so no more than 4‚Äô deep.  Looks like nice stable clay soil.  I would work in it. Great photo. I can totally see this becoming a marketing campaign image.    \"We do the dirty work so you don\\'t have to\" with the plumbing company logo and phone number below. I can almost hear the german mortars in the background Personally I stay out of any trenches deeper than 3ft if they aren‚Äôt braced. It would be terrifying to have one collapse and restrict my chest so I couldn‚Äôt breathe, you can suffocate to death that way. r/accidentalrenaissance worthy? (on mobile... Hopefully that linked right) cross post this to r/pics This needs to be an ad - nice shot r/beneathyourcity r/Beneathyourcity yeesh, wouldnt find me in that trench if it wss raining. good way to get buried Umm excuse me this is not OSHA approved I‚Äôll have to contact your boss and fucking ride your ass about safety for 30 minutes. What company do you work for? -Every. Single. Safety Officer. When I started out as a laborer, I brought in a little black charcoal grill after a few months on the job. Id cook up about 8 or so bratwurst and sell em to the other trades 5$ a pop. Way better than gas station dogs theyd always tell me.  I had a condiment tray and buns, also free bottle water( provided by the GC lol ) Great way to make an extra 20-30 bucks in profit a day.  Edit:a word Work thru on Fridays and get the duck outta there at 130 üíØ We still have over a foot of snow  You are so lucky! In a general contractor and I do this with my labor workers every other week  Oh yeah! One time our driver (who is Iranian) made the guys on site some amazing Iranian kebabs with some chunky vegetable (salsa?) and flatbread. Best lunch ever!  Hahah yea i hear ya Just bought a WSM for the trailer. Going to start chicken and ribs for the safest crew of the week every Friday.  We do Thursday, but same same I used to make barabacoa beef for tacos in a crock pot, set it up in the lunch tent during the safety meeting then chow down with my crew at lunch  You should see the look on people‚Äôs faces when I break out my camp chair. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm some Ham and Egger genius. If I brought a Weber I would have to push broom the mess of all the minds blown. Enjoy your bucket suckers! I work on a small crew residential crew, we have a panini press that we cook just about everything on, every day.   Battery powered dewalt 60 volt grill?  I walked into the trailer this week and found two bags of charcoal. My Super tells me he‚Äôs bringing his smoker in. I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing! Uhhhh rub it in guys!..we‚Äôre not even allowed to have food or drinks on site on a lot of jobs.. like not even bottled water. Shit. Y‚Äôall hiring? Lol  I live in LA and you guys look expensive! White, happy, taking time to enjoy life...  The kind of crew I‚Äôd wanna be part of. Good on y‚Äôall for enjoying life...Looks like a fantastic day at work!! Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuup. Hell no Not so sure about under the work space. At least they got it level, but,  I am not sure they understand the concept of plumb. OSHA approved flat earth my ass I wonder who supported this idea. Actually the OSHA site trailer Just stack some water crates and you can get in. Woooooowwwww that‚Äôs kinda impressive  Bring your own ladder r/OSHA i see maaaany change orders in your future  Did the guy on the left die? That\\'s not safe at all... the step is way over the OSHA maximum of 7.5\".  And I don\\'t see a dead bolt or security bar on that door.  It\\'ll for sure get broken into. At least they got the OSHA notices posted.  Gonna need a railing for the ladder  Are all of your posted regulations / OSHA paperwork posted on the outside since you can\\'t get into your trailer? I can smell the lawsuit through my screen.  Holy fuck. Hurry up put the deck.up so no one sees this shit boys! they should have hired a construction contractor. they‚Äôre good at that kind of thing. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only room on this jobsite for one asshole and I was here first‚Äù                                             -A superintendent It really does.  ‚ÄúThat got me shaking like a dog shitting peach seeds‚Äù My foreman pulled me and my co worker aside after we made a mistake but was easily fixable, he said ‚Äúboys, I want you to  apply this not only at work, but also in life. If you can‚Äôt fix it, don‚Äôt fuck it.‚Äù When it starts sprinkling rain outside. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs roll up before the rain quits‚Äù There‚Äôs was only one perfect carpenter.  And look what they did to that guy.  Also,  My first day working with someone: Them: you like being a carpenter man? Me: ya I love it. Them: you know Jesus was a carpenter? Me: (thinking, oh shit here we go) Yup. Thats what the book says. Them: I don‚Äôt know man. What carpenter can‚Äôt pull three nails?  We‚Äôve been friends ever since. Best I‚Äôve ever heard. One of my bosses asked my roommate to grab some 16 ft 2x4s. My roommate said he couldn‚Äôt fit 16s into his short box. My boss just told him to bend over farther.... ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs enough dicks in this trailer to make you air tight, you better shut your mouth.‚Äù - now retired superintendent. If you fall, you\\'re fired before you hit the ground. ‚ÄúThe only guy who‚Äôs never fucked up an anchor bolt is the guy who‚Äôs never put one in.‚Äù You‚Äôll never lose money on the job you didn‚Äôt get. Looks like a buncha monkeys trying to fuck a football *When somethings not working.  Have you tried cussing at it yet?  You\\'re hired from the neck down. Stop spitting out ideas and start working.  I\\'d never fight over pussy. Theres too much of it out there.  I just got a loan for $5,000. Oh congratulations on going through with your sex change operation.  If you can lean you can clean  There\\'s nothing you can fuck up that I can\\'t fix. You just got to let me know when you fuck up. (In reference to live wires) ‚ÄúBe careful around that. It‚Äôll knock your dick into the dirt‚Äù Looking at something that didn\\'t turn out so well: \"Ya can\\'t see it from my house.\"  Or: \"It is what it is.\" The world wasn‚Äôt built by people who couldn‚Äôt figure shit out.

Around 2:30, then we‚Äôll start again tomorrow.  -that‚Äôs enough to make a bitch wanna bite her pups. The irony that this is labeled ‚ÄúNot Safe For Work‚Äù when these stories all literally took place at work. \"If you wouldn\\'t put your dick in there, then dont put your fingers in there\"  To an inspector -\"who used to bully you in school?\"  -\"Excuse me?\" -\"Nobody is this much of a cunt without a backstory.\" (We got the pass on that inspection too) ‚ÄúIf it was easy the homeowners would do it themselves.‚Äù Hotter than a whore on nickle night ‚ÄúYour gap is tighter than a nuns cunt‚Äù That one just makes me feel so wrong  ‚ÄúI only see things in increments of $2000 because that‚Äôs the most amount of money I‚Äôve ever physically seen‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf the specs are grey, make em pay!‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just ease into the new week‚Äù (fired shortly thereafter)  ‚ÄúIf we like you, we‚Äôll bellhole the pile for you so you can stretch out when you‚Äôre at the bottom‚Äù  Pile crew: if it‚Äôs buried, we‚Äôll find it! I had a concrete guy who hired his son every summer. He\\'d yell at him from across the job \"REMEMBER YOUR PENCIL WEIGHS LESS THAN THAT PICKAXE CABRON!

Bird dogging-when someone is watching you work, it typically looks like they‚Äôre watching you fix a fuck up  Every apprentice is a Hand, so aptly, jobs for apprentices are Hand Jobs [deleted] I‚Äôve been saying the same thing for years. It‚Äôs one of the disconnects between the office and the field. It usually doesn‚Äôt bother me much until I hear one of the inappropriately dressed people complain about the mud/water/dirt. Doesn‚Äôt even dawn on them that the appropriate thing to do is to dress accordingly.   Much higher on my list of things that grind my gears from the office end is the unbalanced sense of urgency. The architect thinks it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to take 4 months to choose a color. But thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous that it takes 6-8 weeks to get the material after the color choice is made. That\\'s a bad job out of the super.  That shouldn\\'t be allowed. Office guy here at an engineering firm. Our team is required to have in the office boots, hard hat, eye protection, jeans, vis vest, the whole 9 yards. When an office guy has to make a visit to the site (and it‚Äôs pretty rare) they gotta have everything the boys and girls in the field have. If not, we get chewed out pretty good by our boss.  So it‚Äôs not everyone! So as a woman in a construction office role, I am always very aware of having my PPE.  I really want to blend in with the site as much as I can. The main issue I\\'ve noticed is with customers that want to visit the site. Sometimes they are dressed inappropriately, and we do our best to let them know when they can/can\\'t visit and provide them with PPE. The steel toe boots are really a sticking point for a lot of office workers and customers. As a woman, it can be really hard to even find a pair in stores. This shit kills me. The hazards don‚Äôt care if you are an office person or a field person, or if you‚Äôre onsite for 10 minutes or all day every day. We had a gal show up in high heels, with all sorts of dangling jewelry and apparently that was a-ok. The way I look at it is if you come out to the site to do anything and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to dress appropriately you are not prepared for your work, same as if they forgot their laptop. My mentor drilled it into me early on that showing up dressed appropriately and with proper PPE is step one towards being prepared for and organized to complete your work. It‚Äôs something that has really stuck with me and I do my best to pass that mindset on. As an engineer, allow me to apologize for my people\\'s part in this matter. I\\'ve personally never seen an engineer on a site without the proper PPE, but I\\'m sure it happens. In fact, I\\'d say that we tend to be over-protected, because we often don\\'t know what the site will be like, so we bring everything Yeah not gonna lie every company I\\'ve worked for expected management to be setting an example. I wear all the standard stuff plus I wear my glasses regardless of the situation.  I know it looks dorky but how am I going to expect guys in the field to be safe if I can\\'t be bothered? [deleted] [deleted] I\\'m a pm. I\\'ve kicked architects off site for not having proper ppe.  Safety is everyone\\'s job. If anyone isn\\'t following the rules, they get told to go play a different game for another gc. This is why I only do residential and small commercial. I rock up at the job, immediately get naked and start putting mud on the wall. Why four inch sleeves? Even better, the chewing out generally has the tone of ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre better than the guys in the field?‚Äù  I used to be a waterproofer in the field, so I greatly appreciate that. Agree completely. This needs to be a zero tolerance thing [deleted] 40c, no shade, no wind in coveralls/steeltoes... The whole shabang, Running one of those 20 pound makita angle grinder on drill pipe boxes I had to roll around the racks; Sorry but the risk of heatstroke is greater than whatever a 1/4\" angle grinder disk can do to my fleshy bits without coveralls (not the fancy breathable nomex shit either we\\'re talkin\\' heavy cotton grease-suit) - That\\'s I snapped and pulled the \"I\\'m not working in these conditions with this much gear find someone else or I\\'m fucking off and going home\" and they fucked off and I got to do my job. - Felt good man.  The earplugs/safetyglasses/faceshield/gloves/respirator stayed on of course but I went sandals/shorts and a white shirt that I soaked in water every 15 minutes because fuck working in coverall in 100f+ temps.  Being forced to wear hardhats doing a roof with 30km/h+ winds gusts was also a good one despite the OSHA exemption for us when there are no overhead hazards because OSHA is not OH&S we still had to wear em, fuck did that piss me off to no end, whelp by the end of the day the hardhats were either tight enough to give ya a gnarly headache or ya stopped giving enough of a fuck to go down 4 stories to go pick it up every-time the wind blew it off. They kept giving us a shit but we got a bunch more jobs from em after the fact so I guess they didn\\'t mind that much...  Don\\'t be too afraid to tell folks to fuck off (politely with some tact of course) if they bust your balls too much. Just don\\'t become complacent about the dangers at play, Mike Row said it best; \"Safety third\", stay sharp and get it done.  Stay safeish! [deleted] Yeah I‚Äôve always hated the second set of rules for the white collar crowd. That‚Äôs not allowed our jobsites. I‚Äôm a PM and full PPE is required if I set foot outside the office area. Goes for everyone, we‚Äôve even told Truck drivers to come back at another time if they have shorts on, I typically let it slide since we need the parts but the safety guys will be all over them. Rarely see that in my area. But in reality it\\'s a matter of insurance. I do CAD now, and opened my own shop. When I was talking to the insurance agent about my job, I wanted to be clear that I would be going to job sites, but that my main function was office. I want to be covered in all cases but I don\\'t want to pay more if they\\'re treating myself and workers like we\\'re full time field guys.   Also for heat management; usually better to be wearing long sleeves than short sleeves or no sleeves. Keeping the sweat on you longer keeps you cooler and slows dehydration. Working in an oil refinery, had to shave my beard, wear nomex, hardhat, steel toe boots, the whole shebang.  Engineer comes out to walk the job, he\\'s a Sikh,  long fucking beard, hardhat wouldn\\'t fit over his turban, so no hardhat, and he\\'s wearing sandals! Fucking sandals!  To be honest I was most pissed about the beard. As one off those assholes from the office...it has to to with the duration of the risk and activity which creates the risk. An inspection job does not require the same safety gear.   That said, making sure to wear the basics before entering a site (proper footwear/helmet/hearing protection). Always check with the on site manager on gear and about potentiol risk factors going on. You know what grinds my gears as a supt? Fucking delivery drivers who don\\'t have proper PPE even though it\\'s on the damn BoL and they\\'ve been to the jobsite before. We were building a large medical facility and the first stage was already finished so the offices were occupied by the company who owned the whole building.  They decided to do a random walk through, they had hard hats and hi vis, they walked in high heels and a guy was complaining the rough ground was going to damage the soles of his leather shoes.  Had engineers walk about with runners but we get fucked for not ticking off a check I\\'m a PM and have worked for several GCs. This wouldn\\'t fly at any jobsite I\\'ve ever been on even if they are the owner of the project. Do you work in the south or for a small GC with a terrible EMR? I‚Äôm a Project Engineer and our company (GC) strictly requires every PE, PM, etc., to have Red Wings or equivalents when on-site. Also we won‚Äôt let Architects or Owners walk on the site without jeans and work boots and proper PPE. Then again, we‚Äôve had one of the best safety records of any GC in our area. Look, the people you refer to aren\\'t working on site every day and often just visit on occasion to do site reviews etc. How can these people be expected to wear more construction appropriate clothes when they physically wont do any work on site? There is also likely a business casual drss code in the office so it\\'s not like they\\'ll just change to come to site.   I get it\\'s annoying wearing PPE all the time, especially for drywallers and finish carpenters but you are just getting yourself worked up over something that really doesn\\'t affect you at all. Where you at u/Julieg21234? This guy is talking about you and your goofy employer. wow that looks super dangerous.. Stairway to Heaven Where is the fucking tag line?  You don\\'t need your hand on it, and you can keep it from bouncing off the walls.  Isn\\'t a tag line mandatory where you work? Why is it when something dangerous is being hung and moved, I just gotta put my hand on it? Wow, I would not get under that thing. so alot more dangerous work to come... stay safe plz This belongs on r/sweatypalms Looks like a unique job to be on. But please get them to throw a tag line on. I would hate to see someone get hurt from an uncontrolled load. I am demoing concrete stairs at my current job and if we could do this, it would have saved a month in our schedule. Instead we have three guys and a chipping hammer. May I ask why? I thought it was a r/whatcouldgowrong and I was expecting the person to end really poorly, but it is not. Good for them! If that concrete snaps, the bloke standing there is as good as fucked. I wouldn‚Äôt be doing that personally, it‚Äôs too long a length of concrete, kudos if you managed it though. Would recommend a second fixing point, with shortened chain at the top side of stair. Alot of load in one spot doing in the way you\\'ve done it.   I wouldn\\'t lift precast stairs like that, so definitely wouldnt trust old ones You are one brave SOB standing anywhere near that while it‚Äôs going out. I‚Äôd be crapping my pants Why not use a bridle hitch with two connection points instead of one? Is this a crane or a helicopter?  You said ‚Äúflew‚Äù in your title, but ‚Äúcrane‚Äù in the comments.  Helicopter would explain no tax lines, as I believe they‚Äôre not allowed when using a helicopter. How are you certain that the stairs can be lifted from one point without them breaking in half?  Honest question! Curious about the considerations being made prior to attempting it. The only time I\\'ve ever done blind picks (20-ish years ago) the crane company had a policy about using visual signals only, no radios. Ended up needing to daisy chain signals through three guys for a few hours to get it done. Went smooth, but made me really worried being the last signal guy in the chain and directing the operator to do something I couldn\\'t see myself. I don‚Äôt like the way he stood under that at times, and he had room to move.  Unnecessary risk No tag line? Where the fuck is the tag line As a signaler, if this is this guy\\'s full time job, he could do better. His language could be more consistent, he could gtfo of the way, tag line(s) etc. oh so your gutting the building? They are like the pirate-bikers of the industry no? Last time we had roofers they rolled up in a black primer coated pickup right out of MadMax they seemed fearless Here in MA roofers go all winter long. Just work around the snow days. Was the same when I lived in WI. Here in the UK they would have to have scaffold edge protection at a minimum. Unless the parapet wall is a minimum of 1100mm.  If that can\\'t be achieved then a temporary mansafe system should be installed so they can harness up.  That doesn\\'t look safe at all. The weather this past week or two has been pretty mild. Christmas Day was almost 55*. Half of my friends that are used to being laid off by now are still getting overtime. It‚Äôs been a weird ‚Äúslow‚Äù season so far. Hell I preferred roofing in northern winter\\'s to the summer. Here in Iowa, we‚Äôve seen 2 really bad snow storms and they were both in late October lmao. Otherwise it‚Äôs been nothing but 30s-50s in December. All the construction workers are out and have jobs, usually dead around this month and early next month, like no roofers anywhere siders, or framers, but we are all up and working like it‚Äôs summer. Where is the flagging or fall protecting?! Just finished a roof yesterday in Ontario. Shit\\'s cold, bruh. Shouldn‚Äôt they be tied off that close to the edge? Great looking building - to bad it needs that fire escape that has such a visual impact. Illinois flat roofer here. We work every day we can through winter Mexicans and the Amish can walk on roofs like I‚Äôve never seen anyone before. No fear Might be warmer winters.... Sadly. Looks like Clifton. Too much economic improvement in Ohio to stop working That means, roofers only have 2 days holiday on Christmas? Roofing in the winter is so much more comfortable than in the summer, in texas at least. You stay warm from working. It\\'s just so gd hot up there in the summer. In Arizona you can see bumper stickers that say  ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for beer, roofers would rule the world‚Äù.  Summer roofing projects in that heat produce a special type of worker. They have earned my respect. They just dress for the weather. Idk about in Ohio but in Illinois it was in the 60‚Äôs last week. Weather was beautiful. Where‚Äôs the fucking harness??? We roof year round here in Canada. Fucking global warming... We\\'ve got roofers running year round in NY those guys are troopers Im sorry? You take the winter off down there in ohio? *chuckles in safety manager write up voice* How do guys have the strength/energy to lift weights after working a physically hard job in the trades 5-7 days per week? I\\'m not talking about office jockey \"construction workers\". Like a mason or a roofer, how the heck can they work out *after* work? Why are they dressed like they\\'re on a gay porn set?  Never trust the overly ripped dude on a job site.  Flip side of that coin is never be the skinny lanky dude on a job site. You should shake the camera some more. this is so underupvoted. You realize the purpose of body training is so your body gets stronger not weaker lol I saw this coming from the other side of the planet. How did this guy not realise what was about to happen? I will never not carry a role of shop towels in my truck with me to have while on construction sites. The quality of toilet paper in the job site toilet should actually be illegal. Plumber here and these are NOT flushable , maybe they pass the toilet but they are gonna stuck and clogg in the pipes I typically carry blue shop towels and a handful of plastic grocery bags to dispose the used ones in. The toilets at my job sites are usually a copse of trees. Oh, and a bar of dial soap. Lol  I keep them in my glove box. I don\\'t flush them though because half our jobsites are on septic and nothing goes in unless it specifies \"septic safe\" on the packaging! When it comes to keeping my junk dry, I\\'ve gone for quantity over quality.  Stopped buying Gold Bond and for the same money buy 4 bottles of generic baby powder.  One in the tool box, one in the truck, one in the office, one in the porta john.  If it\\'s over 80 and sunny I\\'m powdering up all day long. Hell yeah! Gotta get that blood sweat and poop out the crack. I work in the Septic business. Specifically service and installs. DO NOT FLUSH ANY WIPE/HYGIENE PRODUCT THATS DESIGNED TO STAY WET!!!  Matter a fact, if on a septic tank throw everything that doesn\\'t come out of your body in the damn trash can! Idc what they say. It gets in your septic tank, wads up with others and causes a series of issues.   Your trust in a bullshit claim doesn\\'t make me feel bad when you get mad that I\\'m charging an additional $125 (minimum) for having to pull that crap out one clump at a time because it clogs my 3\" hose and prevents me from doing my job.  If you\\'re on a Septic tank, do some research. It\\'ll save you a fuck load of money. Body glide bro....get with the times It is swamp ass season for sure That\\'s a great sawsall in the back though dude. My coworker killed one by dropping it in the lake. I was so upset. Both of those are underneath my back seat at all times. The poop issue is the toughest thing in my job. I wish there was another solution. I even thought of wearing Depends lol. I spy a miluakee user Sometimes looks suspect walking into a terlet stall with my bag Missing diapers for when you pull ground wire....üòâ Who else here team Milwaukee?  You can downvote me. [deleted] The best part about that,  The same asshats that decide you need to sit through a 2 hour orientation to do a 3 hour job, are the first ones that will walk through that tape. You\\'ve successfully prevented everyone from walking through it except perhaps Catherine Zeta Jones. I spray foam and have actually had to remove a guy in charge of safety on a new medical lab with very strict safety rules.  The jackass walked through my red danger tape with a sign saying Proper respiratory protection required, then cut through the plastic I taped over the door opening so we could keep it properly ventilated   Idiots are everywhere I\\'m a floorlayer and this is standard for ensuring people stay off glue or wet patch. And somehow still....footprints... It‚Äôs been my experience that even with all that tape, someone will find a way. I don‚Äôt know how, but they do... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh! More tape for me to cut through! I don‚Äôt wanna go the long way.  Oh so relatable today, I was sealing a concrete stairwell floor, keeping the industrial look I suppose. Well the tile guy decides to run up the stairs despite me having tape up, and my bright yellow ass standing there with a wet floor.   Thankfully the GC showed up in time to yell at him so I wouldn\\'t have to. And this also being the same guy that yelled at my coworker for stepping on one of his wet tiles that wasn\\'t closed off earlier on the job. Every. Fucking. Time. \\\\*Guilty\\\\*  A few months ago the walk way to a leasing office was caution tapped off that wasn\\'t there when I first arrived. I needed a signature to bill them for the minor work I did on the property.  I didn\\'t see anything dangerous, so I just stepped under it and went on into the leasing office.  A few steps into the leasing office I almost slip, I look down and finally realize, the walkway was being painted. I tracked paint shoe prints halfway through the leasing office.  I took off my shoes apologizing profusely, calling myself a dumb ass.  crumpled up the invoice and left out the side entrance in my socks.     &#x200B; Was on a job site today demoing concrete and asphalt at a 7/11 gas station on the corner of a busy street, the whole thing was fenced off except one entrance. We had 4 dump trucks, 2 skids and 2 mini ex\\'s running inside the small space and people kept walking in or driving in to grab something from the store.  I was working in top of a parking garage and had set up orange barriers to block off the top level while we went to lunch. We came back and people had got out of their car and moved them to park up there.  I don\\'t see the danger. I probably would have just cut that crap instead of walking way the hell around... Nice message, but construction workers are still working right now, and we use these same respirators. The shortage is affecting us too. If anyone in the trades has these masks they are using using them for themselves, since back order is over 2 months for this stuff.  Edit: Our supplier just informed us to not expect anymore masks or filters for the rest of the year. We have a homeless family ready to move into the place we\\'re working on the minute we\\'re done and we\\'re working without protection.  We need to protect health care workers. I used to be a nurse, I agree.  But I\\'m really sick of people asking me to give up something that I don\\'t have, assuming that I don\\'t need it. And isn\\'t housing for a homeless family just as important to stop the spread of the virus? My state health department says it\\'s critical. So I go to work without PPE because doctors and nurses are heroes but blue collar workers just don\\'t matter, even when we\\'re contributing to the solutions.  If I actually find some masks, I\\'m sure as fuck going to use them. Guys on our job site (concrete) can‚Äôt even find masks anywhere. What pisses me off is seeing random people walking around the streets with them on. These are people simply going about their daily routine, not healthcare workers or construction workers.  I hope the people in public wearing masks feel safe in their minds while the guys building the medical facilities are getting silicosis. Or the healthcare staff are getting sick from treating corona patients. Fuck off, I was up in this crusty ass attic for 7 hours the other day and we had no masks cause of this bullshit I work as a film carpenter. We got shut down a few weeks ago and our union has been organizing and donating masks and other things (gloves, literally hospital gear from hospital shows like hand sanitizer) but I do worry that when we go back to work we wont have anything. I get priorities, but  sure hope I have a spare set of cartridges for my mask somewhere in my kit.... Another thing to note about these is that you can very easily halve your filter usage by sealing off one cartridge inlet and just using one cardtridge or filter at a time. It‚Äôs not the best way to use it but if you are using the filters as one offs it‚Äôs an option to prolong how many you have I know a couple construction companies that aren‚Äôt donating their PPE since they‚Äôre still working and don‚Äôt want to catch an OSHA violation i was lucky enough to get a P95 3M respirator by pure chance at home depot like 3 days ago. they had like 2 left because someone returned them (wtf?). sealed in a bag so brand new, never opened. Deleted Lawn care and landscaping business owner here, we need the masks in our work too and having trouble finding them... OP, nothing wrong with your post.  But it makes me reflect on how fucked this presidents preparation for and response to this pandemic is.   People serving others, people are dying, and people are sacrificing and he\\'s busy inserting personal tax dodges into the relief bill ..... MF. [deleted] I have a few(2), and I\\'m not working, . However, I can totally see bringing them in and some hospital authority throwing them out because \" they aren\\'t new\"  or \" not the right specs. Do you think that would happen? I\\'m really really poor and the idea of me giving away something very valuable to me just to have it thrown away, makes me worry. I have at least 20 from when I did some home remodeling.   Called a couple hospitals in DC and they said they didn\\'t want them as they couldn\\'t verify they were unused/clean.   Guess there staying in my basement. I should mention that as a construction worker, in Canada at least, I have the right to refuse unsafe work. That can mean a lot of things but in this case, if you are not being provided the proper PPE to do a job safely you have the right to refuse to do it with no fear of penalty. Your employer cannot fire you if you say to them you are unwilling to insulate an attic without a proper respirator. End of discussion. If the health care workers require the respirator more than the engine of a country then so be it. SHUT DOWN!!! Both are important but they are very different. For context: a respirator and a mask are two different things, what is pictured and being talked about is a mask, a wearable passive air cleansing device. What is being talked about that hospitals need to save lives are respirators, machines that actively push and pull air and basically breathe for someone that‚Äôs lungs are too weak. Eye protection? You mean safety squints? #wear your respirator. \"...And don\\'t forget to bring a towel.\" There, fixed it for ya! üëç nice Congratulations! Congratulations man!! Very nice. Most people are just complacent with the position they\\'re in for as long as they can. Completely undervalued themselves and are scared to ask for more money as well. When I hire people I ask them what they want to make. Most people still under sell themselves. I want to pay someone who knows what they\\'re worth. Can you tell us more about the position and what kind of company is it? What experience/certs did they consider?  Congratulations! I\\'m happy for you Right on! Congrats bud! Work hard and it‚Äôll pay off! Right on! Congratulations and best of luck. Congrats my man! Keep asking for more! I would up vote but....niiice Good for you. Lots of people get complacent. In their role, and in the roles of the people working for them. Some of them even actively try to keep you in a role that\\'s just a stepping stone for you, not a career goal. Friend of mine wanted to move to another division in another state, in his same company, and his boss actively tried to keep him down. He had to go over that boss\\' head to get it done. That sort of thing happens too much, and no one should ever stand for it.  Onwards and upwards, good luck to you. Get it! Saw a fire truck drive into the job across the street from mine. Hope whoever it was for gets to drive home tonight. This shit ain\\'t worth dying over. Really drives the point of safety home hearing stories like this so close to home. Safety is a culture and we are all in a brotherhood union or not.  Be safe out there guys. Wear that ppe bros. Getting the job done ain\\'t worth your life. I catch myself doing sketchy shit all the time. This is a sobering reminder that tragedy can happen at any point to anyone. Really really sad to hear. This is in my backyard. From what I have heard BP refinery is really strict on safety, doesn‚Äôt really matter how it happened, all that matters is this man went to work, and never came home. Sad however you want to look at it We just had a guy last week fall from 5ft off a ladder during a wire pull and fractured his pelvis with internal bleeding. He‚Äôs gonna be ok but still very humbling.... we are not invincible.  Stay safe everyone Fuck.     23... fuck. Had a first year apprentice fall from a scaffold pulling wire last year, he survived but is paralyzed from the neck down. Always look out for yourself when someone tells you to do something uncomfortable. Speaking of PFAS. What is the most comfortable one to wear? \"those who are green\" what does that mean üôè the article says 2011 Looks pretty safe to me. Also pretty fun [deleted] That gave me a heart attack! I didn‚Äôt see the crane... At least the operator is wearing a hard hat and hi vis vest... Props to the operator. Saw the collapse before anyone else did.... How is a wrecking ball not an option, even just a giant piece of metal rigged to the crane to use as a wrecking ball would be simpler and safer. So cool, one long reach excavator would have done it well but this seems alot more fun It\\'s ok! He has his harness on! Bucket laser best laser. Annnnd spot the foreman  I know these have been around a long time and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs completely safe but... nope! Is that quickstop and sawdust between the piles 3-4 FT below water level to get the seal?   This is a confined space? Also to get in and out wouldn\\'t you need fall protection to get in and out?  The health and safety standards in the states always astound me. Could pick a dozen violations from this photo!  $10.00 says the concrete guys get it out of square! lol  That‚Äôs awesome. My company is in the process of bidding for a 1million+ sq ft warehouse! [deleted] Erecting columns and placing trusses prior to having all slabs poured and panels up? someone is on their scheduling game. Welcome to Dallas! Stay off of 635 and enjoy your time here.   Is this for the new Ashley\\'s distribution center? Sweet. I like those big jobs. I\\'ve done a couple $100M plus Why is the mesh in the bottom of the slab? Incredible Is that the one going up right off of Preston near 380? Is there a vapor barrier under that slab? I have a question on getting the concrete panels to build the warehouse.  Do they form the panels at the site and then lift them in place or do they ship them in? Welcome to Dallas! I‚Äôm in construction in Dallas also.  Jesus christ, before looking at the title I thought this was a runway outside an airport or something! I do install at fire safety solutions in Farmers Branch. strong chance they‚Äôll contract us so i may see ya there!  There‚Äôs tons of em going up around here Nice rebar work. Looks good. Who is doing the concrete?  How long does it take to build 1M sq ft? Amazon facility by chance? I‚Äôm currently at a 1 million sq ft project for them that will be turned over in a couple weeks. I\\'m doing some precon work on a 2 million SF building right now. Shots crazy big. Peinado the GC? As a fire guy, this looks like utter hell. What\\'s the eave/peak roof heights and the slope? ...can you cut tensioned cabling like that within a slab? How does that work? Precast guy here and we usually just use quick cuts for this and it‚Äôs a pain in the dick Looks like ineffective fall protection. It\\'s nice sometimes when you can just get the job done without someone screaming \"FIRE WATCH! WHERE\\'S YOUR FIRE WATCH!\" No water? Were the planks left long intentionally or are you fixing an error? Beauty picture I hope you were wearing your safety glasses when you took this These are hollowcore slabs right? Thanks , makes it easier then cutting it while hanging  prior to dropping in . Nice shot ! I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúpost tensioned ‚Äú cables blow !  You‚Äôre right . They can kill you. They ripped right through 10‚Äô of 20year old concrete deck like butter on My job !  Fuck we were shitting BLOCKS Measure twice cut once, better long than short... Did you score cut first or just go full depth right away? Badass cranes I can see that tower from the tower I\\'m working.   If a tower like that one needs to be demolished how do they do it? Floor by floor? Who‚Äôs the GC and major subs?  Any insider stories from the project?  Major problems / unique design etc I wonder, is it safer to have the booms straight up during offtime? I could see it preventing some strain in certain places, but also creating it in others.. Anybody have any info regarding such? That\\'s some glorious \\'essential\\' work.. What‚Äôs up Toronto! I drive by this building all the time on the way to my site. Ahhhh this is 81 Bay Street , I was there for the last 10 months , it was a shit show walking up all those stairs when the hoists were down ; people still working at this  job site during corona ? Yikes Terrible non existent transition from deck rail to stair rail.  Definitely appears to exceed 4\". Stairs? *Sure but they didn‚Äôt say anything about them having a landing or not finishing in the middle of the yard.* [deleted] I love flaunting code violations looking for praise too. Either you‚Äôre a clueless homeowner or a hack contractor. Smh looks nice af, but I can\\'t really tell, because of the sod, if that has a poured concrete base. Without that, you\\'re basically relying on the top attach point to hold all the weight. I like to secure both top and bottom, so it sort of wedges itself in the pocket between the two. Makes that stuff last damn near forever. Also needs risers to make sure you can\\'t trip. I\\'m basing everything I\\'m saying off of code for my area. still nice work tho *Looks* great. I\\'m not sure your local code but you definetly need a landing if you\\'re going that many steps in one shot.  EDIT: OP, take all these comments as constructive as you can. Not meant to dig at you. If I was inspecting this or building it I\\'d review a few key components to the design.  1) Check that ledger ensure its lag bolted solid.  2) Strong tie hangars on every joist.  3) That\\'s a long span on your fascia/beam. You want that to be 2x10 or 2x12 doubled or trippled up. On point load connection with carriage bolts.  4) Stairs. Those are too much of a risk.      You want a solid footing, that way you can tapcon a piece at the bottom step (cutaway on the stringer) acts like a brace to avoid it ever sliding or moving out from under. Too many steps for a single flight. Few steps up to a landing then continue from landing to second story. The only thing I like is the grass. The only thing.   Good god is that house ugly.   The posts on the bottom are not actually on the bottom--that\\'s dumb. And the mid span posts are not even mid span between the stupidly located bottom posts and the top posts.  The hand rail around the deck is not contiguous with the handrail going down the stairs.  The lack of risers is disconcerting and wouldn\\'t fly where I am at.  The span is too long without a landing.  And there is a piece of blue tape stuck to the siding. wtf. A lot of steps there. I do not like it. lets post the illegal staircase I built and would be liable for if someone died on the interwebs! look guys I did a good job! OP stop trying to justify the fact that there is no pad for the stairs...you are a hack plain and simple. Would of dropped the railing one step down rather than up My two pennies. Not a deck builder, but understand decks.   1. Should there be any cross bracing on the deck joiist underneath? 2. Should there be a third post in the middle for the deck? 3. Are the deck post the right size? 4. What are the deck (and stair) post resting on? Does it go below the frost line? 5. In just looking at the deck, it looks good, but something tells me it‚Äôs far from code. I‚Äôd be interested to see the ledger board and how it is fastened. As well, the post connections too at the top.  6. Not even a concrete pad at the base???? 7. In my area, that run is allowed to go without needing a landing. 17 is the max.  8. The first step doesn‚Äôt match the rest.  9. The hand rail is interrupted on the stair.  10. Aesthetically, attaching the rail to the house is not pleasing to me. I‚Äôd imagine this goes against code though. Needs its own post right, be able to support 200lb of lateral force? 11. Did he seal the stringer after cutting? 12. What‚Äôs up with the two rim joist boards on the front of the deck? aaand lets just run this staircase into the fuckin lawn down there aaand.. done! specialist style üòé [deleted] I\\'m surprised that nobody\\'s talking about the span of the cut stair stringers. The max. span of a cut 2x12 isn\\'t specified in IRC, but it is specified that the stairs have to support a load of 40 psf. IIRC, a cut 2x12 stringer spaced at 18\" can only have a max span (measured horizontally) of about 6 ft. I know that he\\'s doubled up the exterior stringers, but the two interior stringers aren\\'t doubled and they carry more of the load than the exterior ones. I\\'m pretty sure if you actually did an analysis of these stairs, they wouldn\\'t support 40 psf. These steps make me worry what the flashing at the ledger board looks like as well as the hidden girder. There are stair railings but I don\\'t see a continuously graspable handrail? Along with other\\'s observations, how did this pass inspection? [deleted] I would have gone with \"Firepole\" I would be so upset if that was my house. No way in hell this has a permit associated with it.   I just put more structure under a deck I\\'m building with a buddy that\\'s 1\\' off the ground ffs. This just looks irresponsible. Da fuck? All things said I still would have built the stairs on the other side of the deck if I were you. lol Good work mate! It looks aesthetically very pleasing but if we consider the construction point of view, like safety standards, I still believe that rail could be extended to the bottom tread.   But in case all the residents are healthy and fit, I don‚Äôt think anyone would mind that rail not reaching the last step. Moreover, I could understand how last-minute additions to an already existing project could feel.   Good Luck!  :) More impressed by the railing! Also, I don‚Äôt do concrete. I‚Äôll let them figure it out Update for expected criticism: Sides are doublers. I was worried I would need a crossbrace in the middle (+2 footings to dig and pour), but after removing my temp purlin they feel super solid. Had a 350lb coworker jump in the middle with very little variance. Terrain is the hardest/dryest clay I‚Äôve ever dug so I think the bottom is fine. Concrete pad was not in my bid to GC I\\'m aware there are issues, but I couldn\\'t do better myself yet. So I will give an A for effort. Nice work! I‚Äôve done similar sets of stairs same situation. Customer is always right! That sells for 150k here in NYC just like the banana In the dead of winter the framing nails bunch together for warmth. They will remain motionless unless disturbed by a Cat‚Äôs Paw. [deleted] Target practice. Must be a sheer wall.. Someone hammered as much of a coil as would stay into a wall. That‚Äôs what happens when there‚Äôs a spider crawling on the framing. Nailed it!! It‚Äôs called art Drywallers will get it Went to the site and got hammered. Dialing in a nail gun or teaching someone to do the same? That‚Äôs called a gang nail üòÜ Never laughed so hard just reading comments haha Time for an angle grinder with a cutoff disk. , l nfd*ck!?!?!??, c6   is 4 in km no. Looks like they marked the stud to plane down, just want to make sure they dull the heck out out of the portaplaner Nice shooting Tex Someone doesn‚Äôt like the Boardman. I\\'m greatly disappointed that there is not someone\\'s hammer or nail bar under all those suckers Cause fuck the drywallers, that\\'s why... I used to nail like 4-5 nails in a clump if I was too lazy for a ladder... Totally safe no worries everything turned out okay I hate it when carpenters don\\'t hammer nails in all the way Looks like something I‚Äôve done. We were in the testing phase so I was just chilling waiting for them to need my help so I drove every spare screw I could find into an extra junction box I had. Just making sure the hammer still works üëç This is the work of someone who quit. \"Art\" Nail orgy The same vibe with poking a whole on an eraser Just adding value Maybe a spider there or something  Edit: Was* [deleted] This is precisely my wife using every single power tool we own.  She\\'s not exactly safety conscious, and really doesn\\'t want to hear about it.  At least they‚Äôre wearing goggles.  Dang...so close to the holidays. That‚Äôs quite a load on the shoulders of the new helper too.  I\\'ve been doing construction for so long that I forget that it\\'s still a dangerous business. Thanks for the reminder, it\\'s a good wake up call. Jesus. What a terrible scene to witness. Prayers to everyone involved and the family of course. The most important thing to know about a machine is how to shut it down. Sorry for your loss. Condolences. Not sure about the rules but if there is any type of fund for the worker\\'s family, please post it here or pm me. Stay safe out there.  I\\'m so sorry for your loss. :(  Remember everyone, the Site Safety Officer is your friend, not your enemy. Please do what they request, they just want you to go home to your family. Sorry to hear that. How is helper holding up? Last year or the year before right before Christmas I was digging shallow test holes at a project and a drill rig was doing the deeper holes that I couldn‚Äôt dig down to. The driller was bundled up for the cold weather and his helper walked away from the rig to shoot the shit with the soils engineer. In that time his clothing got caught up in the rig and the rig tore him up. Even with a off duty fire fighter on site he passed before the ambulance could get there. The machines we deal with will tear through rock, snap trees and deal with abrasive materials all day. They don‚Äôt know the difference between dirt and flesh. Alway be aware of your surroundings. Our area had a fatality this last spring that was that same thing.  Directional drill rig near where he was putting up tiebacks and something happened.  PTOs, drill rigs, paving machines... always be extra careful around the heavy stuff.  My condolences to you and his family. Im sorry for your loss of a team member, sending thoughts and prayers your way. can someone come up with clothing that tears away easy?  better to be stripped naked than dead. no? There was a drilling accident here in Alaska today with a death also. Very sad.  damn bro...  I worked for a tree company for one month until there was not enough work. Within couple of months, I read about a teenager getting sucked into the tree shredder; the boss was his father and he had a heart attack on that scene. Brutal  Got a call for my first outside line work as a groundman, crushed my finger on my 4th day. Shit was demoralizing and it took me a year until I got another call to work.  Be safe y\\'all Fuck, sorry to hear. My condolences.  Oil worker here too. Terrible news. My sincere condolences  Condolences. I heard about a kid that got himself tangled up into a pipe threader around this time last year around me. Wearing a hoodie with the really thick drawstrings dangling and pulled him in.  I pave roads. Just yesterday one of our laborers got hit with a skid steer and shattered both legs and one of our truck drivers fell out of the bed of his truck while spraying it with diesel and tore a ligament in his shoulder. Always gotta stay alert and take your time.  Was that at Milne Point? It‚Äôs terrible to hear.  Damn, I\\'m sorry. My condolences. This just reminds me how lucky I‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve seen some bad accidents and involved in one. We were all lucky enough to go home,   Take care of yourselves and your coworkers, especially if your company can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt.  During my job this summer I got injured and had five staples to my head and came close to being crushed by scaffolding too. It‚Äôs a dangerous field and safety is always an issue. Another coworker of mine lost two fingers from an accident so understand why companies take safety so seriously.  That would go great on my Ryobi cordless  Nice! that little hilti (dd350?) looks a little out of place. thought you guys were all about the hydro? Safe to say you are going to hit some rebar lol The bit is kinda impressive, but look at those blades in the background! \"Whats that block you\\'re putting a 2 inch hole in? Oh nevermind, that\\'s the bit\" ... I\\'m trying to figure out how much that bit costs ‚Äú*Iiiiiiii like big bits and I can not lie*‚Äù That custom set up for the drill is nice yes but will it fit in my honda? Why even bother installing a floor if you\\'re just gonna cut half of it off Hello fellow ccutter! How did your hold go? Is that a husky and a 35horse corecut I see there?  Where you based bro The stains and discolorations are beautiful. Like an art piece I‚Äôm pretty sure even my DeWalt 60v FlexVolt still won‚Äôt handle that. üòÇ Fake: didn\\'t see a single crackhead on that crew Omg this is so hard core and dramatic. I love it. I know the firms ive worked with check all media released, even things like workers not wearing long sleeves can ruin an otherwise amazing shot. [deleted] I can smell it It\\'s funny how slomo can make things so dramatic This is incredible footage! What are you using to capture? Post-processing? Yeh you\\'re right, upto them! I was hoping to see the finished product. Still a bad ass video üëç Why does it remind me of coffee beans What did you use for this? What device/program? Looks great Good ole d dog Looks like everyday for me. I love it I love the aesthetic of dirty grimy machinery still just churning away. I always loved driving the skid steer at work. I\\'d actually like to try my hand at asphalt.  There\\'s a lot of work out there for it. For the love of god, make them diesel the gates! Dope vid!! Are those guys meant to be wearing more safety gear? Corporates wouldn\\'t use such footage if that\\'s the case. /safety inspector has joined the game Looks like Colorado It\\'s a big snowball about the size of a big snowball Didn\\'t film it rolling into the road? NVM I\\'m super high it shattered Montana? Big Sky area? And then there‚Äôs regular joes like me who make giant dicks with their footsteps in the parking lot. Okanagan Valley B.C. Okanagan Valley B.C. Now we need fire extinguishers at the hand washing stations... FML. Cool, now we\\'re gonna have to fill out a hot work permit every time we hit the hand san dispenser Nothing I didn\\'t know but I\\'ll definitely be more aware of ESD possibly igniting hand sanitizer from now on, thanks for sharing I\\'d just received this and thought to pass it on; identifying information removed. You‚Äôre not on fire, Ricky Bobby ! We used to douse our hands in rubbing alcohol and light it with a lighter This is very interesting and I wonder how statistically significant. You can put ‚Äúflammable‚Äù on the product all day, everyone knows that. What most people DON‚ÄôT know is that static electricity could ignite it.  They should cover all sources of static electricity with these labels. Oh no, this is like poking yourself in the eye while putting on safety glasses... makes me wonder if zero incidents is even possible. I burned my.hand like that in high school.... Thaut it would be Kool by pouring  the Bunsen burner alcohol on my hand and then lite it....it was the 80s teenager trying to reproduce a MTV music video scene, what could go wrong..... \"Kill it with fire.\" 70-90% alcohol is flammable.. this obvious I‚Äôve seen some dumb shit on the internet. This will be filed in that same cabinet This sub is becoming my favorite one, the quality of posts has really gone up Not a cheap pull I haven\\'t seen a dolly like that used before, does the dozer have an air supply for the trailer brakes? Was that a Tremors reference? Riiight... Just hope it doesn\\'t rain [Thats cute](https://imgur.com/W0a7rzV)  Actually your load is probably heavier.  It may seem a bit pricey but it can be the best and safest way to do things. Nice setup, gotta get creative sometimes. What\\'s the purpose of the totes? We used some this summer to create the main body of a levee for a stream diversion to complete a pour in place box culvert. Really enjoyed the utility of them. The safety guy hates you. we used to be able to use earbuds on 1 side, but some dumbass on site got his headphones ripped into the table saw. Typically they don‚Äôt want headphones onsite because they want you to be able to hear, so a sup would probably still say something Shhh. You‚Äôre gonna spoil it for us. No music devices of any kind.. headphones.. radio.. truck speakers, etc...   We are required to wear ear protection.   These would work better for me then putting a random sparkys company name on my radio and listening to that. Don\\'t listen to OP. This is the worst advise. You need to be aware of your surroundings on a job site. You will not hear anyone trying to get your attention if something is about to cause you harm or you\\'re about to walk off an edge. Good way to get killed [deleted] [deleted] I work industrial construction and your hearing would be shot to shit in a week with those things. And the safety guy is gonna love you for actually having your ear plugs on I\\'ve used my active noise canceling earbuds on a job working in a pre-fab shop. Didn\\'t even have them plugged into anything. Just had them on, they have a battery. From Phillips. Worked fucking great, you could other people waaaay better. Killed off a lot of the 60 hz hum everything electrical seems to put off. Killed a lot of back ground noise. They have rubber earpads, I just took them off, cut off the top two domes of those triple dome ear safety plugs. They have a little hole in the middle for inserting the lanyard that were easy enough to get over the earbuds post. They plugged my ear better, came in orange. Safety guy looked at them and never said a word about them. They just looked like they were on a lanyard. The battery back on the earbud lanyard I had under my work shirt. Check these out ...Awesafe Ear Protection for... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BS9SXSS?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share Nice headphone jack Oh fuck yeah thank you haha Can I get a link op I have full cover electronic shooting ear protectors that when they are on you can adjust the volume to hear low decibel sounds like voices and when the level goes over 82db it cuts the noise out ...Amazon has them for 40 bucks and you can also plug your phone in them to listen to music To the people saying your gonna die. No. Use common sense, google mike Rowe‚Äôs safety third. Just put your phone on like half volume and put it in your hard hat. It amplifies it enough to hear it when not doing something really loud and it‚Äôs nothing in your ears for the safety guy to bitch about. As a GC for me these are just great. If you get hurt I\\'ll just say I thought it was hearing protection, or later if I decide I dont like you I\\'ll just use them as an excuse to send you home. Your company will say you didnt follow the rules laid out in your contract, and in the contract they signed with my company. Then they will terminate you for cause. But hey, at least you got to listen to Pantera while you lumped pavers. Do they sound any good? NICE...... thanks for the heads up brah. F the safety Nazis on here. I have been doing this for over 20 years 99% of injuries are self inflicted by stupidity. I know this project and this exact location. I‚Äôll upvote for that lol. Any chance you know where to get that soft brim for the hard hat I could use one of them for the summer Birmingham 59/20 bridge work! Safety sombrero? Vermiculite. In our market (MN) 3/4 of the vermiculite has asbestos in it as it came from a single mine in MT. We don\\'t bother testibg it, we treat it all as asbestos. Maybe other areas of the country it is a lower percentage but I wouldn\\'t touch it again until it was tested.  Any half way competent contractor is gong to have a \"hidden conditions\" clause in their contract, which this would fall under. If your boss says don\\'t worry about it, don\\'t give in. You see those none stop Mesothelioma adds? Who do you think gets it? Hint: people who worked with asbestos! Looks like vermiculite. Vermiculite. Asbestos, gtfo. Option 1: If it tastes like pepper, you struck the pepper gold mine. Proceed to package and sell  Option 2: If it tastes like asbestos, ask yourself how you know what asbestos tastes like, then proceed to package and sell as pepper.  Option 3: Put a scoop of it in an abandoned mine with an apprentice. If the apprentice survives the night, package and sell as pepper.    All options allow you to start a lucrative small business.  You‚Äôre set for life pal.    PS. Treat it like it‚Äôs radioactive. Secure the area, call for a test. Keep area secured until you know what you‚Äôre dealing with. I‚Äôve come across this as a supervisor. I made a poor decision and told the labour‚Äôs to go away while I cleaned it up. I used an emulsifier to make it safe. But I still likely contaminated myself. Not worth it. Follow protocol.  Edit: also taste that plaster stucco stuff on the cinder block.... Vermiculite.  DO NOT blow on it or allow it to get into the air, as some vermiculite production was contaminated by asbestos.  It needs to be tested by an accredited lab.  If it\\'s the type without the asbestos, then vacuum it up. If it DOES contain asbestos, then either seal it up, or hire a decontamination company to get rid of it. Not only is the vermiculite dangerous but if what you‚Äôre doing is widening an existing opening, you‚Äôre taking away the header bearing if you destroy the vertical pilaster with the rebar in it. Might want to use shoring if the header stays or the CMU can come down on you unless you knocked it out already. Is this your worksite? You are going to want to get the fuck out of there and not go back. GOLD! You struck gold!  Kidding, that\\'s vermiculite. Its dangerous, be careful please. Might want to google Libby Montana vermiculite. [Asbestos](https://www.medicinenet.com/asbestos-related_disorders/article.htm#)  This is one article, and there are many.  What you want to avoid is creating dust of anything that could contain asbestos fibers.  Their danger comes from the fact that if inhaled or swallowed, the fibers and embed themselves in epithelial cells.  They are stiff, resistant to chemical breakdown by the body, and cause damage by acting as miniature saw blades that cut the cell every time it moved.  After a while the cell loses its ability to try to heal, and can start on the path towards malfunction and eventually, cancer.  But it can take a long time (and some continued exposure) before there are enough fibers to cause obvious effects.  The best methods avoid creating dust, and if dust is created, then you protect yourself by wearing respirator masks suitable for screening out fine powder. I\\'d say the end of your work in that area until it\\'s tested and most likely remediated. As stated : Vermiculite for insulating Blocks Yea good odds this may contain asbestos, so you should get out ASAP and have this tested.   A company I was with years ago had a similar situation (cut into a block wall) and exposed a crew to asbestos. It was a terrible situation for everyone involved! Spider eggs Its a form of insulation. Looks like sand. Its gets poured into the cavities of block walls (old practice) to insulate the wall itself. Hit something similar a couple years ago renovating a governors mansion. Was told it was old fire proofing? Oh boy Bird seed, that house was made by a sparrow Bird seed, that house was made by a sparrow Dog, get out of there. Gold Mouse poop President of my local is a female. It‚Äôs getting more and more common. Went to my union meeting on Thursday. It was actually initiation night for the new apprentices and I want to say there was at least 2 if not 3 new plumbers/pipfitters/HVAC/Welders.  &#x200B;  Slow change, but change. Female project manager checking in for remodeling company! get it ladies! It\\'s happening it just takes time. My wife has gone from a safety assistant to an on-site safety manager in a little over 3 years and is working towards more certifications. The only thing I don\\'t like about it is that there are still old people who think they can act unprofessionally towards her because she\\'s a woman and that shit drives me insane, but then I can\\'t go picking bones with people on the job because it makes my wife look less than capable so I just have to support from the sidelines. I high five the boilermaker Moms hustling and grinding to support their families. It is tough work. I‚Äôm in fourth year electrical school right now and I thought ‚Äúhey, there are a lot of women this year‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs great.  But then I realized it‚Äôs still MAYBE 5% so quite low.  That said I‚Äôve worked with a few women and they‚Äôre totally welcome in my book, I welcome that change. I have several women on my site now, and I guarantee they work harder than these dumb dildos running their mouths on this thread. One of the best operators I‚Äôve ever met worked her way up from (literally) the trenches, and is now a PM and estimator.  I\\'m a little confused when you say that\\'s rare. I\\'ve been in construction since early 00s and worked many projects in many states and each trade had quite a few women in the field. I\\'ve had bosses that are women and been trained by a very intelligent woman on a specific job in my field many years ago. It has never been strange or a focus to see a woman working in any field where I\\'ve personally been.  I‚Äôve worked in the field for 3 years too and we have a framer who‚Äôs a straight lady bad-ass. She does better and more efficient work than most of the guys. ü§ò  I also worked for a manager at the start that literally said to me ‚Äúwomen shouldn‚Äôt be doing this type of job.‚Äù I asked him if it was because we were more efficient and flexible than men. I got crickets for an answer. Then the company got acquired and he was NOT invited to stay. Later days and better ways! üëã I\\'m a female and I work in construction tooooo!!! Yesssss girl Hey! Female third year carpentry apprentice here! Don\\'t see many others in the trade (small town, here), but when I do, it\\'s like the [same hat meme](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/6394969856/h471C26EC/). I remember years ago when I was still going through trades school, I had one instructor who really hanmered home the importance of women on site, it went something like;    ‚ÄúGuys, when you shower and get ready, what do you do? Towel off, pit stick, shave, brush your teeth, comb your hair, get dressed and done, right?‚Äù   Most of us nodded in agreement     ‚ÄúNow think of your girlfriends and how long and how attentive they are to their getting ready ritual. Shower, towel, blow dry, style, pickingclothes and fixing make up, and we all joke that it takes forever, right?‚Äù   Again we all nod.     ‚ÄúNow think of this, do you want to weld a pipe set up by a guy who pays attention for 10 minutes and calls it good? Or do you want to weld a pipe that was set up by someone who is never happy until its perfect?‚Äù    In my experience women, although not quite at the physical strength threshold of most men, are hilariously more detail oriented and very much ‚Äòit‚Äôs not perfect until it‚Äôs perfect‚Äô types. One welder I met up north, Paige (I think) was the go-to for tig. No one could touch her work, it was, for lack of a better term, beautifully crafted.     But you need all types of people on site. For every rammy mother fucker just slapping shit together for their inches, there‚Äôs those that take the time to perfect the details to make sure it‚Äôs done. It might be a transition point now, but by the time I retire I expect (and hope) for a level field.     TL;DR    Women are generally more attentive to the details, and every site needs that.  Yup! In my college courses women are starting to fill some seats. Go girls !  My division is about 50/50 I think. Female manager and head office engineer. 1/3 of our REs are female as well. I will say it is usually less for the field personnel. Usually an operator or two. Hopefully the trend continues and more female workers start joining trades.  I work in a construction company and many of us engineers here on head office are female. You can also see a lot of females on construction sites. Well, it‚Äôs given we live on a different country, but the world is getting there. ‚ò∫Ô∏è this gives me hope. i\\'ve been looking into trades as a career option but they all seem pretty male-dominated. i hope i can find an apprenticeship somewhere. i wouldn\\'t want to be unwelcome on a job site or be hired on to fill some quota. I recently got some great literature from my college CM program showing that females in the industry make $.94/1.00 as opposed to the national average of $.78. While it‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs a promising indicator of the growth towards equality. r/casual_female_uprise It is a good thing without doubt, when the woman hired is there to have a go and wants to learn. I\\'ve had the pleasure of working with a few women who were driven, hard working and absolutely not afraid to get their hands dirty and they were exemplary workers. To be clear, I\\'d 100% support hiring more women like that any day of the week. Unfortunately, those women have been in the minority of the women who have been hired in this industry. I\\'ve seen way too many hired for diversity reasons who just drive around all day doing absolutely nothing and still complaining how busy they are or if they had to shift a temp fence panel or something. When assigned a job, they will go and convince someone else to do it. If you ask them for help lifting or something, their back is hurting. If you need them to get their hands dirty, they have to go to the toilet. They will constantly tell people that things are not their job and when things go wrong, make it abundantly clear that they have zero responsibility. That\\'s on top of the sick days once a week, the gossiping and backstabbing, the sleeping with supervisors to get it easy etc. Hiring for diversity alone is bullshit and shouldn\\'t happen. Hiring because someone is actually a good worker or wants to learn to be one is the right way to do it and it\\'s the only way women will find acceptance in the industry. If you\\'re one of the supervisors who hires these women, spend a bit more time on it and make sure they actually want to be there, rather than just grabbing one for diversity sake to keep head office happy. If we hire good quality women employees, it\\'s a fast track to change. If they continue hiring shitty ones, then people will stop hiring them full stop.  WHO GIVES A SHIT there are women on every jobsight I\\'ve ever been on. Just do your job, nobody cares Interior Designer here. I have been working in commercial for 12 years, so I spend a decent amount of time on site.  I‚Äôm usually the only lady.  We need more gals in the field!!   (I always have to prove I‚Äôm not an idiot when working with new GCs. I mean, IDs can be super obnoxious, and often times can‚Äôt detail for fuckall. But we aren‚Äôt all morons!) If the job can be done equally by a man or woman then who cares. Get the job done.   I do think the ‚ÄúPC‚Äù crowd is a bit ridiculous in ignoring the fact that men and women are built differently though. We are different, and that‚Äôs ok. Why is that so hard to accept? Different genders do things better in certain cases.  Required diversity hiring quotas are the reason. That\\'s great . Women in this field get leniency though don\\'t go believing equality is a 2 way street cuz it still isn\\'t. I see apprentice women do easy ass work because the foreman doesn\\'t trust her frail body to carry a length of 3 inch up a flight of stairs. I ain\\'t trying to shit on you I\\'m letting you know ow that your achievement isn\\'t quite impressive We had a bad weather yesterday. Every woman called in with and excuse, kids needed picking up etc... No guys missed the day. Woman are a liability that needs to be acepted because theor feeling might get hurt. My roommate is a second year carpenter , misses nearly a week each month because of cramps... bring the down votes i don‚Äôt really care. And know ‚Äúrosie the riveter‚Äù quit after a week because the job was hard :(.  Bullshit, there\\'s a guy with a broken arm though. This is actually illegal according to OSHA 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) if you would cancel the next party because someone got injured because it encourages workers not to report safety issues.  What OSHA would rather see is rewarding people for reporting. For example, completing GOOD JSA\\'s, filling out near-miss reports, identifying unsafe work environments, would be counted towards the next party or raffle.   You never wanna be that guy that reports the small scratch on day 199 Without *reported* injury you mean! haha  I respect the safety pizza party, I have often done the same with my subs.  Well done! god damn thats a big ass fan! What trade? One of my favorite stories is from an old superintendent of mine, built an entire WTP with no recordables and had a BBQ chicken dinner to celebrate. Someone got a piece of chicken bone lodged in their throat and it resulted in a recordable.  Nice! We just celebrated 365 days yesterday :D Bradfield & Gorrie? Pizza Party!!! https://youtu.be/R7vUBDWyl-Q LIES!... IT\\'S ALL LIES!  Lunch tents are getting super fancy now! There‚Äôs a factory around here that‚Äôs about to hit the 10 year mark without a lost time incident. Pretty impressive.  Beat his ass Dump that old man out of the wheel chair Ive been in spots like this. It was 3am and we were backfilling a gas main we were installing. Some guy drunk out of his mind drove inside our cone patten right along side the trench and almost killed my foreman. Loader operator jumps out, tells the guy to open his door and rips him out of the car and just screams at him pushes him around a little. We had a cop on the job and he was totally understanding, of course the guy was arrested for dui. Guys just because we‚Äôre on the job doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt defend ourselves. In the case of the video the guy could‚Äôve said do you mind moving the ladder for a second? I don‚Äôt do that sort of work but in my experience if we‚Äôre working in the road in front of someone‚Äôs house we drop everything to get them in and out of their driveway safely, stop traffic, put a plate over the trench etc. just be polite, we don‚Äôt want to make your life difficult we‚Äôre just doing our job Isn\\'t that the old dude, Salamanca from Breaking Bad? Call the cops, charge him with attempted manslaughter. You can\\'t be that fucking stupid and get any sympathy from me. Especially when it\\'s obvious he selfishly wanted the ladder moved so he could get by. Fuck that guy. Beat him over the head with my ladder he just broke I\\'d fall feet 1st on the old man... Roll him over into oncoming traffic Holy shit!!! What the hell is wrong with that old man? He needs to be criminally charged and forced into a home. Fuck his daily strolls and piss in his jello! Wheel his bitch ass to the porta potty throw him in there, take his wheel chair. Lock the porta potty and tip it. No porta potty? Throw him in my trunk and figure it out from there  Edit: a letter I would have literally beat his face to a Bloody pulp then dragged him up that ladder and throw him off as high as I fell. Fucking old prick I would beat his crippled ass Falcon KICK This is insanely rotten. Coning off the sidewalk would not have stopped him, he was pissed about not being able to get by. He would have thrown those outta the way then done the same thing. man that elder guy didn\\'t give a fucking fuck if he killed someone damn just just damn That dude just landed directly on that ladder with his back and the guy in the white shirt is rubbing his back for him. Idiots all around. I think if I were the guy on the ground I would have hit that old bastard If I was not heading to the hospital, he would be! Disc herniation  for sure,  the old man should  know better. Dang do you think this dude has alzheimers or something? A lot of times old dudes go nuts and get fairly aggressive towards the end when it gets bad. What a fucking prick. This man is out of his mind but fuck are we bad at legal shit If I could get up after that fall, I‚Äôd toss his bitch ass out of his chair like he tossed me off the ladder. I felt it when he grabbed his back after the fall. God can you imagine wondering why you\\'re on the ground and while you\\'re rolling around in pain theres a pissed off old man telling YOU that you\\'re in HIS way! In all fairness, this looked bad all around.   No safety cones. No one on the ground keeping watch. Why was this a good time to do this when there is so much foot traffic? Perhaps all parties involved were short in their planning and execution. Am sure someone was trying to save money and/ or time.   When i did commercial work we always had extra hands on deck in such situations.   That being said, the old guy deserves a criminal charge. OSHAs gonna wanna see handrails  The craziest part is that this must have been kinda tricky to form so there was obviously some thought put into it. Just really low quality thought apparently.  [I don\\'t care to know why tbh...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tom-delonge-wtf1.gif) That concrete has rebar straight through the middle connecting top to bottom, it\\'s designed to take an Earthquake, even if those supports kick out, the worst that\\'s gonna happen is it\\'ll sag like a wooden rope bridge.   Just don\\'t jump up and down on it.  Get back to work I\\'m not paying you to be the health and safety inspector. Who even put up the 2x4 stilts? Like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm not sure if we will be able to save this but let‚Äôs brace it up just in case‚Äù They‚Äôve got posts up under it, looks stable enough to me. As per spec. Just check the engineering sheets. Yep, all good, and you got not 1 or 2 but 3 2x4 vertical bracing, super legit üòú I see nothing wrong with the picture in question Bob the builder did it. That\\'s what they wanted... Bob did it. Me I sorry I need the link to the clip of the appliance guys bringing a fridge up on a hand truck [Story Link](https://13wham.com/news/local/dump-truck-trapped-under-downed-utility-poles-power-lines-in-henrietta)  We currently have 45 linemen out cleaning this up, and they\\'re getting double time too! \"Sir, you can come out of your truck now.  The lines are de-energized.\"  \"It\\'s okay.  I\\'ll just stay in here.\" Hey I think I see your problem, the power poles are supposed to be vertical, not at an angle. Just stand them back up again, should be easy.  /s Oof.  Mondays.   First the boat now this... rochester is creating a name for itself!  Oh that is bad... Really bad. I wouldn\\'t care if I got fired, I would have shit myself in shame.  That reminds me of a delivery at River Road in Jacksonville.  A mixer truck caught a line coming out of a long driveway and pulled the power line down, catching the neighbor\\'s palm tree on fire.   It was a mess.   He looked like he had about 50 tickets in his hand when I passed him. Are those poles a bit overloaded? I wouldn\\'t think you could take that many down. Fucking Rochester. Work safe, brother! How? That many poles is crazy... did the dude just floor it out of the school or something? So i\\'m not in construction or drive a dump truck, but personally I\\'ve seen quite a bit of dump truck operators drive off sites with the bed still fully up. Is it really not noticeable driving wise when the bed is fully extended, that it could be easily forgotten about?  I can see the backcharges bill now ! Sorry , shit always happens ! Wow. Where do you even start? That article is hilarious! One driver had to make a small detour because the road was blocked. Two more people we\\'re evacuated from the area because they didn\\'t want to stay home.... And three in NOLA. RIP, dude. I‚Äôve had a few close calls, spilled and seen a little blood, but I‚Äôve been lucky to make it 35 years in the trades relatively unscathed. Be safe out there. Turner is one of the most qualified GC‚Äôs out there, but when you work on as many jobs as they do, something‚Äôs bound to happen... Jeesh! Wasn\\'t there a collapse when they were building the casino down there? so sad.. people dont really understand the dangers and the casualties of this work... plz be safe and wary at work.. your family waits for you at home I was teaching a lecture today on casting supported slabs and the importance of the reshoring.  Needless to say, I\\'ve just emailed this to the entire class. Friday, Friday, gotta dig down on Friday  sucks bro, what\\'s the afterstory? able to find a valve nearby to shut down? plumber with a concrete saw and an excavator?  &#x200B;  looks like water & sewer,   &#x200B;  as somebody who\\'s hit a water line before (and it was in fact on a friday) , call before you dig! Should have gotten out of the machine and done some hand digging! God I hope that\\'s before the meter Gotta love it When I told my father I was thinking about becoming a plumber, he told me there‚Äôs only two things you need to know, 1. Shit flows down hill, and 2. Payday is Friday.   Guess he forgot about force mains.  hopefully its all overtime Fresh water 12 inch main. And thankfully it‚Äôs hit fifty degrees today. Better then the -5 earlier in the week. But we dug it up because it was already broken. Lifted the parking lot about 4 inches until we popped it  Nice sneakers.  I find when guys cut conrerns on safety, they tend to do it elsewhere as well.  Not sure what the story is here though, but call b4 you dig! Sigh...why friday Yep happened to me I take it you don‚Äôt get the automatic double pay for fixing a water main? Former plumber, now videographer! Promotion! It\\'s gonna be a short weekend. Something\\'s fucky That happened to me the other day but it was on a smaller scale. Half inch copper pipe running an inch below the surface of a concrete slab that I was chipping up. The headshake sold it. That‚Äôs got to smell terrible! Looks like some vermiculite fell out? If so, hopefully you watch out / stay safe around asbestos! Aww hell naw... why\\'d you break it? Oh, so there is a place you wont put your finger. My back hurts just watching that. How those guys can tie the mat all day long , without bending their knees . I think they are the strongest men on the site. Man, every part of that job looks like it sucks for your back Some part of me thinks the tool would still be faster overall especially if you had 2 because you can work at a consistent pace. I find it hard to believe that you can hand tie that fast all day long without slowing down significantly. Tbh, this seems like a good task for a robot/ai. It\\'s a very singular goal with a very uniform work environment. That‚Äôs pretty nuts. I‚Äôve used one of those tie guns before and I‚Äôm really impressed how a human can beat them by hand. Rod busters have the hardest physical job on site. Maybe scaffold builders are tied. Mad respect for what they do I think it would be better to say the tool does the job without the physical strain on your body.  Theoretically at least. There are many tasks you could do perfectly fine without certain tools, but is just smarter to do with a specific tool. Like bullies. Sure you could throw a heavy object on your back and climb a ladder up to its position, but you risk your safety and if you do it long enough health.  I don\\'t know the long time effects of this, but I imagine that using a tool that can do the same thing but on a stick so you don\\'t have to be down might be slower than him, but might keep his back healthier for longer. The union guys around here can barely work with one hand let alone two... Too many narrow spaces for drones. I think AI will take over many jobs, but skilled labor like this is harder to automate than retail or a desk job. Yay snap ties Killer on your pinkie pulling with those side cutting pliers [deleted] I\\'d rock the shit out of those if they came in a safety toe version. I hope his socks and pants are flame retardant because those shoes are straight fire. Look great. But most GCs in our area specifically state in the contracts that all contractor and subcontractor employees must wear work boots with steel toe or safety toe. Safety shoes are prohibited Yeah boi post it to r/sneakers too If those came in 4E wide I would totally rock those. OSHA says work ‚Äúboot‚Äù Residential Super here on east coast, haven‚Äôt missed a day since...  Company applied for multiple exemptions that have been approved by Gov.   People need their half million dollar houses to settle on time..   It‚Äôs very essential /s I‚Äôm in the bay working commercial and we are still going. We just had to scale back the crew size. Traveling super. Was working on a commercial project in San Jose. They sent us home about three weeks ago and then laid us off.   Now running a multi-family project at home (Southern Utah). Elevator Constructor here in SF. We are still working. I‚Äôm on a affordable housing job. There are lay offs/furloughs In my trade but for the most part we‚Äôre all working. I have a feeling this might change in the next couple weeks.....hoping not but totally understand if they do. Be safe out there everyone. I\\'m in residential in the Midwest. We\\'re working  I\\'m glad for the money but some of the work sucks without PPE  Stopped into the HD for safety glasses the other day and it was a ghost town. Totally freaky. The safety aisle was pretty bare, but they had my glasses We do additions and renovations in Florida. Nobody wants us near their house right now. We also had a renovation in a condo where the HOA put a stop order on all work in the building. That was supposed to be what kept us going for the next 3 weeks. Gives me time to do some projects around the house I‚Äôm curious, I see the majority viewpoint is that construction should stop though I‚Äôm surprised by that since it would mean that everyone would be laid off. I have some money saved up for such a purpose but I hope to never have to use it or apply for unemployment. I also understand that a lot of jobs are not practicing safe measures.   My site was lucky to be early on in the project with small crews and got supplies early so we have good measures unlike a lot of what I am seeing. Even still, I‚Äôm surprised by the overwhelming majority that would rather have all work stop. Am I missing something here? Does everyone just have backup cash to get them through being laid off for a few months? I would appreciate anyone‚Äôs feedback. Residential tile guy here, I was going to try to stay busy in New construction, but now that\\'s dried up, or at least slowed down.  And people are calling about remodels which I told myself I wouldn\\'t do during this thing.  But now I don\\'t know if I can just pass on everything and maybe file unemployment or do what\\'s irresponsible for my community and go after every remodel that comes my way I\\'m an estimator - I\\'m sitting at home all day but we\\'re just working from home now. Double bad. Home is supposed to be my safe space where work doesn\\'t exist!  Gotta say, though. Those ITB\\'s sure have slowed down. Bah..im in canada.. we got 5 or 7 projects on the go.. yes it\\'s hard to keep track. Not everyone wants to work... some people have to. I have to. I also had to let go of some people....  One guy with a massive drinking/ coke problem On guy with a drinking problem One guy that does stuff but you have to re do a lot of it..  Yeah theas guys had to go no matter what. The work force shortage is ridiculous... we had to let them go because of the lifestyle they led... sketchy friends public transportation and shitty hygiene..   So now I\\'m doing everything... I got hundreds of hours banked... hopefully its all worth it. I\\'m doing small home Reno\\'s still. Roofing contractor. Starting lots of roofs tomorrow I‚Äôm working commercial but my projects are for the federal government and are funded from national defense funds so they‚Äôve been determined to be mission essential. I\\'m in Western Canada. Our company has loads of work for a while yet. Actually, looking at potentially hiring. My wife wants me to take time off to work on our own place. South east residential man here ..I have been busy between 2 houses (both large projects)  I have a helper a few days a week when needed and it hasn\\'t been too bad for me . One house the customer is a teacher and has been quarantined pretty much since school stopped. And the other home is and has been vacant for a long time so I work alone there which is nice ! When I go to depot , lowes, or the lumber yard I wear my gloves N95 mask and safety glasses for sure . I wash and or sanitize my hands before getting back in the truck trying to limit my exposure.  Thus far I have been blessed with work and health so I\\'ll keep paying the bills as long as I can stay safe. All construction is full steam ahead in Australia. Could change in the next couple weeks, but no one has said anything about it yet. We are doing split start and break times as well as social distancing, one person per vehicle etc. Gyms, cafes, restaurants etc closed. Most office workers doing it from home. Traffic has been great! Most are glad to still be working, but also pretty scared about the virus. Lot of older blokes, smokers, overweight etc people in construction in Australia, so if it did get into the industry, it would be really bad. Commercial foreman are working in the bay Commercial super in the midwest. We\\'re not slowing down yet! Commercial east coast. Still working. PM for high end spec home builder in Houston.  Still have boss and clients pushing like crazy for closings.  We had already over scheduled ourselves for April with too many closings and it\\'s only worse now with some subs not wanting to work or suppliers closing or having different procedures. We have 10 projects going right now. 3 close in April and 2 in early May üò© I‚Äôm a commercial construction worker that‚Äôs home now. It‚Äôs a parking garage in the bay, our company has 3 jobs in the Bay Area and mine is the only one shutdown right now because of the county it‚Äôs in. I‚Äôm starting to feel liked we‚Äôre the only ones not working. Boss is having a meeting today to find out when we go back to work after San Francisco extended it‚Äôs shelter in place to another month. Do you not want a job? Do you think we all just get a vacation? I‚Äôm in construction but I‚Äôm still working from home and sometimes the office. The best is when they add gravel to \"help\" so then you just have Rocky mud lmao Been there.  I feel your pain op.  That makes me feel slightly better about my day. Thanks! I‚Äôve only seen mud like that once. Upstate NY. It was a nightmare.  Craft is covered in mud before they pick up a tool. Why would they care about the work they do if that‚Äôs the greeting they get when they arrive? Welcome to Canada!! This is poor project management.  Pure and simple.  There is no need to work a piece of equipment in those ground conditions. It‚Äôs mildly unsafe as well depending on the task assigned to the operator.  Not to mention the cost overrun associated with cleanup after the fact..... Past time to get to rig mats placed? This looks like my site! But it could be any site... yay for mud season!  Dat compaction Update: It rained this morning. FML Why does everyone skip the step of just putting down base first and waterproofing the work area? I can‚Äôt figure out why people are surprised by muddy conditions or complain about lost productivity. Plate your work area!  Oof So the best solution is rig mats, correct?  Are there still good solutions that are more cost effective than rig mats? It‚Äôs rut szn boys.  Bring in the big rig to compact it then lay gravel Few tonnes of gravel my friend. Remind the person cutting checks that the holdup and extra fuel use and drivers wages will cost more than the gravel in the long run. They\\'ll have the gravel waiting in the morning. Why wouldn\\'t you clean it up so you have a decent work area? Their concern is legitimate. If anyone thinks Safety or cleanliness regulations, on an active job site, is going to prevent people or their families from getting COVID, you are absolutely kidding yourself. ‚ÄúThe union says the Trump administration\\'s order blocking OSHA from issuing regulations to protect workers from COVID-19‚Äù  Why am I not surprised. I don‚Äôt care if your union or not. 90% of construction you can‚Äôt social distant for. Try installing a window with one person or a 250# door. I‚Äôve been doing carpentry for 20+ years and have done a lot of stuff alone. Theirs some you just need more people for. I also hear about the other side because my wife is a nurse. Trust me you don‚Äôt want covid-19 They\\'re walking off our job at Somerville HS on Friday. I\\'m in local 4, IBEW and laborers are apparently out so we\\'re out as well. I‚Äôm a small remodeling company and there is no way we can be six feet apart working in a bathroom or even some kitchens we do.  Two of my guys left the state when this all started and the other two are too scared to come to work.  So it‚Äôs just me and my husband finishing up three job sites in various stages.  Only one of the houses is actually occupied and I insisted the home owners wear masks while we are there. I wish my state would shut us down, I hate going to the hardware store. Good start we are 200 000 construction worker not working in quebec.. Everyone needs to wear some sort of mask 100% of the time when in public, folks. Curious if we could go back to work with 100% respirator usage. Go figure, a union ordering its members to not work. How innovative Wondering how consistent it is at maintaining the proper spacing and if it can move the double weighted barrels. I‚Äôd definitely buy it for our crews. Less guys on the road the more comfortable I am.  Never can fully trust the traveling public.  Dey took err cone moving jerbs! This is very satisfying to watch  More efficient than ever at making my commute miserable! Reminds me of the time I was moving my 18 wheeler steady through a 1 lane construction quarter and came upon a big ol orange cone RIGHT in the center of the lane, that all the cars in front of me were going around. Unfortunately I can\\'t play zigzag in a semi so it wound up under my bumper for a few miles. Got out to check on it when there was a safe shoulder and it was gone lol. I did pass a cone crew. Most-likely using something like this here. r/SpecializedTools  Was a PM on a post office in Miami, structural guys found a body when digging the footer. It was across from the police station. Not sure what happened... but my crew got the day off Was on a subdivision projects and the edge ran next to a small natural gas facility. The haul road ran right next to it and a 637 clipped a 4\" pipe that showed up on the edge of the road. Lot\\'s of oh shits but thankfully it was a dry stub. Who called DIGSAFE?! Was working on building an access road in a tiny town right off the highway. Found a skeleton under the culvert bridge thing that we were making wider. Got off work for a couple weeks, didn\\'t get paid for them though. Im a construction plumber, we were doing underground piping for a old age apartment addition and we hit this big steel box, me on the mini excavator thinking it was utilities, we made the call for locates. Well anyways we eat lunch and i get back at it, again being careful because of the fear of inaccurate utilitie marking. I then hit a wooden box 20ft away from the steel one. Hop off the mini ex and go in with a shovel to uncover this box. Anyway 3 shovels later, i finally clue in what the boxes are, it was an unmarked barial ground.   The most fucked part was i found out later from the guy who the city sent out to inspect the site that steel coffins were used to bury people with deadly diseases. Pretty wild stuff. Also he told me that while he drilled a hole in the side of the coffin and black liquid came out. What happens if you do find a body? One time we were digging a ditch and hit a root that looked red. It looked just like a cable. I even checked it with my pen tester before we realized what it was! Lol I literally said \\'oh shit\\' after saw the photo at first glance. LOL Lol I‚Äôm glad you can laugh about it. I‚Äôm not superstitious but I will definitely not be buying any of those houses. He‚Äôs got that stacked so high it makes you actually understand why the ladders on top. You guys talking trash but never actually went frame to finish...  Even a bathroom remodel in a busy suburb can have your truck stacked like this on dump run day... Looks like load in/load out day. \" hey Jimmy can you grab the jigsaw, should be by the shop vac somewhere\" This guy needs a Mercedes Sprinter. One call does it all I‚Äôm so confused I see pick straps, ladder, pigeon hole shovel,  maybe a vibrating skreed?  Wtf is this guy on his way to do Or he just robbed somebody\\'s trailer. I‚Äôd love to see the yard sale (from a safe distance) if he had to swerve, or make any kind of emergency maneuver. If e swear that this was my nephews truck if it weren‚Äôt for the California plates I‚Äôm sure he does a decent job. Just needs a larger truck. Lol ...except organize The life of a hard working contractor.  Most of us like this will do more work loading and unloading tools in a day then most do all week.  And that\\'s just to get a job started. Jack of all master of none hah Chuck in a truck. Idiot I got lucky at 17 when I got small wood chip lodged into my eye while cutting lumber down. Couldn‚Äôt even open my eye enough to wash it out it burned so much. The next morning my eye was crusted over, I guess it tried to heal itself. Anyway it was blurry in that eye for about a week. Now I have a sweet red scar on my eyeball and I always wear eye pro. The vegetation in the background tells me this is somewhere tropical where the rules don\\'t matter and safety is optional. 30\" hydraulic handsaw is no joke but I don\\'t see anything wrong with this - aside from the lack of hearing, respiratory and eye protection. This was probably taken someplace like florida where the concrete is soft.

[https://youtu.be/bWxGaoPIBSM](https://youtu.be/bWxGaoPIBSM) Happy independents day! Amen to that buddy! Scaffolders - let\\'s be honest, no one grew up wanting to be a scaffolder. HVAC Take that damn Sawzall away from them. Elevator installers - prima donnas of the trade, will show up and leave for 3 weeks because of (insert minuscule thing). Drywall: seemingly know all the lyrics to every sad norteno song but sing terribly. Insulators: around here they seem to be the nicest and dumbest guys who all attend the same church.  I‚Äôve never met a gruff or rude insulator - never met a smart one either. Painters - carpenters that never learned how to work a measuring tape.  Electricians: always whining about cold, heat, exhaust fumes from machinery, paint smell, want to have access to everything in the space everyone is working, both self depricatingly sarcastic and superior at the same time. Tile Setter- Two types 1. Fast as hell, nothing‚Äôs straight, grout and caulk covers a multitude of sins. Here for the beer money.  2.  Slow as molasses, expensive as electricians, a tool-and-die machinist would be proud.  Brick layer facts lmao Architect - ah shit, who invited him?  Sprinkler fitters: too stupid to be plumbers or pipe fitters.  Plumbers: don\\'t call me a pipe fitter Pipe fitter: if shit run through it, I don\\'t do it!  Quality control/inspectors need one lol.  Maybe knows everything. Knows your job better than you do. Looks for shit, and lives off misery.  That\\'s what the guys at work sometimes say to me about my job anyway lol >Safety managers - middle child. Ginger. Virgin. Too harmless to get pissed off at.  LOL  I love when they struggle to fill a required safety brief when I\\'m just out for a quick estimate or measurement.  \"Uhmmm, don\\'t trip I guess? Maybe keep an eye out for meteors? Be mindful of environmental hazards like high pollen count and ultraviolet radiation from the sun.\" I feel like concrete finishers and masons have a lot in common in that they are like Marines in different stages of their life. Finishers are the one fresh out of service, still all muscles and no brains, and not afraid to run their mouth. And masons are the exact same except they got fat, but thinks it‚Äôs still muscle.  Roofers. Drunk or high 24/7 Sheet metal workers - no one likes you on site when you show up to do your best impression of industrial music.  > Concrete workers - always pissed off. Bitches about silica exposure while opening up their 4th pack of cigarettes for the day.  lol\\'d     rod buster - loud, dirty, alcoholic. always needs to bum a smoke but never buys any themselves. will place bars on anything, including other peoples tools, power cords and loose lumber.

Carpenter\\'s Helper: Cuts/shapes puzzle piece #42. Sets up work site, cleans up work site, does all labour. as a bricklayer, FUCK OFF.   &#x200B;  :) Commercial carpenters: push a broom and install doors. Eventually become a site super Plumbers, all you need to know is, shit flows downhill and payday is Friday. Ironworkers- multiple DWI, union stickers covering every square inch of hardhat, laborer with a welding ticket General contractor - a framer that had enough money to start building their own houses. Obviously knows everything about every trade.  Electrician - pull those wires as tight as possible and make sure they\\'re in everyone\\'s way. It\\'s allowed because they\\'re the smartest guys on sight.    Sheet metal - complains about everything. Loves bulkheads and dropped ceilings.   Drywallers - the dust has affected their brain. Anything that\\'s in their way gets destroyed.  Insulators - friendliest people you\\'ll ever meet.  Plumbers - a mixed bunch. Sometimes they\\'re your best friend and sometimes they\\'ll screw you over.  Framers: We only put that 5 ply beam there so the hvac guy can cut it out for his cold air return.  Ooh, ooh, do Architects > think they should be superintendents. Bitch about how every other trade is incompetent and slow.  This isn\\'t entirely true, we just don\\'t want the current super to be the super Finishers - piss bottle champions      Tin knocker - ex con  Truckdrivers are the GossipGirls, that carry their Shit and Rumors from Site to Site.

Thinks the good ole days were a lot better. Always demanding the smallest extra jobs to appease the supers\\' standard protocol requests. Talented at wasting 3 hours playing wit the apple tablet.  What would you consider ‚Äúactual carpentry skills‚Äù?  Genuinely curious.  Inspector: requires parking in job site if it is outside of the acceptable 68-73 degrees F. Just wants the measurement for his report so he can sit in his car. Either 23 and dumb, 85 and senile, or 50 and just hired as a family friend with no experience. Can\\'t read the plans well enough to know when their is or is not a problem. greatest ability is plausible deniability.  Roofers- the most overlooked of the construction crew also usually the oldest people on the job and they smoke 2 packs a day Operators: will call a labourer to move something small in front of their machine.  Source: am operator  Engineers: think in 2D; charge for change orders to fix conflicts in their design Electricians- #1 task when arriving onsite is to figure out where the break area needs to be Oh, I see the drywall guys are onsite  Thats why we have those Pisstands/urinals on wheels...  place them in an small room in a corner for privacy and nobody has to piss in bottles.. and once a week you roll em out and the Portapotty guy emptys them.. costs ~10$ a week  Fucking disgusting. Anyone in my company caught pissing anywhere other than a goddamn toilet would be promptly shitcanned.  I learned real early on to never open a drywall bucket on a job site unless you brought it yourself. Ha. It\\'s funny bc pee. Yes this is common on our job sites unfortunately. Yes it\\'s mostly the sheetrockers. I laughed my ass off when I saw [this article](https://pagesix.com/2017/10/30/bottles-of-urine-found-in-walls-of-luxury-nj-condo/) on the topic. Happens at luxury places too.    the wide mouth gatorade bottles are the best.  never buy the yellow gatorade tho.  Used to work at high altitudes--no bathrooms, carry in, carry out.     As a tradesman for over 15 years, I\\'ll throw anybody under the bus as hard as I can over this.   It\\'s disgusting, are we animals? Apparently some are. It gives all blue collar workers everywhere a bad name.   If any of my guys do this, and I find out, it\\'s immediate two checks and dont let the door hit you on the way out.    Or truckers, or farmers,  or Amazon  employees, or miners, or, or, or... piss jugs are everywhere. Never trust the yellow water. It\\'s a minefield out there.  If you are a new guy on a paving crew don‚Äôt drink any bottles on the spreader. It‚Äôs usually a diesel mix for the equipment. I‚Äôve seen 1 orange hat (new guy) take a swig before and throw up. Those and spit bottles from the guys that dip.....fucking gross Whoever did this one appears to have been weirdly well hydrated. I just imagine some poor soul putting in new fixtures, updating the hotel, and drilling into one of those after sitting in the wall for 15+ years; turning brown and fermenting.  Has anybody on here from Canada ever seen this?  I\\'ve never seen this.  I\\'m residential though. That ain\\'t lemonade. One time we had a pill billy of a sparky pee on a box of our plumbing fittings for no apparent reason . people get crazy gross They\\'re all over the scaffolding in a boiler. The project manager for the company I was working for on that outage had a high speed come apart at a safety meeting over it.  Also don\\'t open the 5 gallon buckets that feel light when there is no porta potty on site A couple of months ago, someone pissed in a register vent that was to be under a cabinet. Savages. I would rather see this shit than deal with that. I\\'ve caught a pest control contractor taking a piss in a bottle inside a finished, operating factory. It\\'s not always the drywallers... R/gatekeeping  I can confidently say I‚Äôve worked on numerous large projects and I‚Äôve yet to see a piss bottle. You guys understand why Gatorade bottles have a wider mouth?  Taxi drivers will understand.  &#x200B; Yeahhhh haha I drive long distances for work, and absolutely HATE having to stop to take a piss. SOOO I\\'ve started having my wife save our laundry detergent bottles for mobile Porta potties haha - they have a nice wide hole, a sturdy handle, and are large enough to use  about half a dozen times before you gotta toss them in a dumpster lol As a general contractor, no this is not a thing.  This is evidence that you have homeless people on your jobsite at night, or it is rvidence that your subcontractors are hiring homeless people. My red cooler... A sign of good times, weather it\\'s camping or on a beach. Now it will be the face of good times to come if we stay clean.  Filled her up with water.. Open up the valve and behold! Apple blossom nice Genius This is why I volunteer to do the dishes every night.    *I want to see a new Dawn.* Already one confirmed case in my site...Still open. I\\'m at home on voluntary iso due to minor cold symptoms (recoveing but playing it safe just in case). At last I\\'m management and can still work on estimates from home (thank Jesus Christ for salary).    Stay healthy my fellow hard hats. We will beat this. We will keep building. Looks like someones been playing too much bridge builder What a fucking complete catastrophe. Sucks for those dudes. Lol the \"FUCK\" scream and distressed beeping of forklifts at the end ‚ÄúPIVOT!‚Äù FYI a load of that many strings of rail is roughly 60tons.   It looks like at least 130lb rail. (130lbs per 3 feet) and they\\'re 80ft long.   I don\\'t know anything about fork lifts though. So maybe they could technically do that much weight. The second I saw they needed to drive up and slope, pick up a load and then back down a slope I knew they were fucked with vertical mast machines. When the camera moved and I saw the other forklifts I cracked up. It was so obviously going to happen. I didn\\'t see the derailment coming though, what a fuckup I\\'ve tandem picked shit but that was retarded Lol that\\'s a big ol fuck up As my favorite contemporary hobo would say - FNBS. RIP stobe. \"boss told me to do it\" I want to meet the engineer in charge if this \\'it looks safe\\' seal of approval This made me lol on lunch today. Thankyou for the laugh my dude. Inexperienced operator vids are always good entertainment...and good for learning from ofc. My heart was pounding just watching that....  Why didn\\'t they get a crane?! Getting fired simulator 2019 happy cake day OSHA doesn\\'t cover physics. Do tell me how OSHA had anything to do with this? OSHA exists to extort money. Lol.  If I don\\'t want to wear boots, that\\'s my business. I\\'ll sign a fucking waiver. OSHA makes shit more difficult. That\\'s it.  It used to be good. Dude probably will drive to work all proud and excited about finally proving himself to the guys and when he gets there he will be treated with his coworkers walking in, glancing at the work he did, saying nothing, and continue walking.  And then we will have another young man on the way to being a semi depressed walking cigarette lol Commerical drywaller here. This is why we insist on topout first so we don\\'t spend  eternity doing that. Non constructor here, how hard is it to do that? Does it take a long time to measure? Insulater here. Looks good bud, nice cuts.    Do yourself (and me) a huge favour going forward. Find out which pipes are the cold ones, and leave enough room for at least 1\" of insulation (especially on chilled water).   There\\'s a drop ceiling going in there right? Once those tiles go in nobody\\'s gonna see your nice cuts or mine, but if the insulation isn\\'t sealed around the chilled water (or the main cold line) it will condensate and stain the walls/tiles   Stay safe out there, and keep taking pride in what you do Is that a smoke wall? Then plumber realizes he missed a run and just breaks all of that w a hammer and runs his copper line through.  Ahh I miss it Hey there are actually 4 more 6‚Äù lines that will need to go there soooooo just take it down and put it back up.  Nice work. I love attention to detail on stuff like this. Usually everyone just half asses it and says ‚Äúthe (trade installing work next) will make it look better‚Äù You forgot the sleeves Did you do one or two layers of gypsum? you left plenty of wrinkles in that tape there Jr. Punch list item #457: Pipe penetrations not caulked per specifications section 257.345.100.1.A subsection B which references NAIMA 401 stating pipe penetrations must be caulked.

It may not be well received, come Monday. ‚Äúboss i‚Äôm all done! take a look!‚Äù  ‚Äúwhy did that take you so long? get upstairs you have 3 more floors to do‚Äù  ‚Äúoh...ok‚Äù Hey at least the fitters kept the hanger out of the wall by less than 1/4\" ü§£ Shouldn\\'t put screws in the top track. Could crack if there is any deflection. I have a Box of plastic forks in my glove box,  they\\'re like 2 bucks for 50...  My guys noticed started doing the same,  voila... Forks available at all Times... OP: Boss, I need another pair of glasses  Boss: That‚Äôs your third pair this week! What happened to the ones I gave you?  OP: Well..... Keep your eye on this guy! He\\'s an innovator!  If they don\\'t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy. Keep your stick on the ice Ha thats a new one That\\'s pretty good!   I started keeping a box in the backseat with plastic cutlery, learned that lesson once and won\\'t ever again.    Next issue is for when I\\'m on LOA, I need to remember to pack at least a couple contaners or bowls. My last out of town job I was eating those salad packages right out of the bag. Dump the dressing and toppings, mix it all in the bag and you\\'ve got your bowl. Doesn\\'t work too wel with anything else though. Haha nice. On two occasions I\\'ve cut chopsticks out of a 2x4.  Get a sparky to give you a small length of 12/2 romex. Strip about 1.5\" of the wires and bend to a fork shape.  Wow not bad. You should be an engineer.  I‚Äôve had to use the top of a yogurt cup or those little applesauce packages. I was really desperate once and used a fairly clean putty knife. I try and keep a few in the truck though.   Great pull OP I have found that Chisels work great , especially for spreading peanut butter but this here my friend is genius.  I will be breaking a pair of safety glasses soon!!  /r/OSHA Um, I\\'m a woman, so I pack my own damn lunch and I never forget cutlery because I have a multi-tool from REI in a pinch. I\\'ve been known to use a wooden shim. Safety glasses cut where the bridge of the nose goes. Instant spoon One time for a team building event we brought a bunch of 3‚Äô subs to the job.. things were huge! Only thing around to cut them with was a sawzaw blade O worked with a Super that was an absolute legend for this. I once watched him eat lasagna with a ballpoint pen. Use the lid apprentice. I\\'ve used my pry bar to scrape the wax ring off of toilets too many times. Automatic gag reflex. But this wooden shim idea intrigues me.... Romex makes a good copper fork I generally make chop stick by splitting the grain on a 2x4 block WhatsAchipFer? Pocket knife; is knife, is fork, is spoon. Trying to suck yogurt out is worst, especially if they don‚Äôt have a foil cap to use as a spoon I\\'ve ripped a 1/4 off a 2x4 and used it to eat leftovers. Flat fork for the win I once borrowed two butter knives to eat my lunch. I got razzed, but it was effective. I used a plastic putty knife for my tapioca last week. I\\'ve used pens as chopsticks to eat a salad. I carry utensils in my bag now lol. I install flooring and use my hook knife alot it seems like. I\\'m hungry! I ate my lunch with a clothes line peg the other day, bad day to bring leftover curry for lunch. Funny you should mention it. I at quinoa salad I made with my face today The good old wonderbar. Truly has gotten me out of shitty moments at work Made a fork out of a chunk of downspout when I was doing gutters. I\\'ve always got my 1\" margin trowel I go to the pack of Ticonderoga pencils as chopsticks. Multiple times. Nothing like using your coworkers fork after they are done eating, just gotta give it a good old fashioned germ ex wash. I‚Äôve used cardboard and plastic bent in a V shape and my knife just all sorts of shit I‚Äôd have to sit down and make a list. Had to cut watermelon with a sawsall once Ate chili with my house key once. It\\'s got a wide handle with Darth Maul pictured. Thick chili was a plus Well, I guess I\\'m adding a pack of plastic cutlery to the random emergency stuff in my truck. I don\\'t personally really eat lunch but I\\'ll be dammed if I\\'m letting someone eat off a prybar.   I\\'m the dude that always has spare: water, toilet paper, paper towels, rags, gloves, glasses, paint brush and rollers (still hear my co-workers \"you don\\'t even paint bro wtf\"), roll of plastic drop sheet, roll of paper drop sheet, three kinds of tape, blades for every tool I own, two kinds of wet wipes, three cleaning solutions, five tape measures and utility knives (I misplace tapes and knives like it\\'s a mental disorder). I hate having to run to the store for something small I just use my pencil All the time. Fruit skins and chicken bones make excellentl substitutes The glazer bar is the most useful tool in my belt Yup, I usually end up fabricating a piece of copper into a spoon or fork. Plumber btw.  Edit. What kind of special idiot downvotes this? Lol. Legend I prefer the stainless steel veneer tie. I‚Äôve heard time and time again that the construction industry is male-dominated, but this seems excessive. Ah yes, the good old suicide plug. Very common with homeowners wanting to backfeed generators into their houses on the cheap. Lmao... have him hold the end while you plug it in. Had a coworker/ welder do the same on a 208/ 20amp twist lock , he figured it would be fool proof to copy the original end. Sad to say it wasn‚Äôt the last time he done this! Shit\\'s gay yo. My buddy did something similar with a shop vac.  Installed the female end on the cord.  I went to go plug it in and wished I had a cord like yours lol That‚Äôs the ghetto ass adapter for hooking up a generator to a receptacle circuit. Heard about it from a guy. It\\'s only gay if they touch üòÑ Ohh. It is so hard to find a crossover electric cable. Either way, if OSHA sees it you\\'re going to get fined. Safety 3rd! YEE old widow maker Love the Mike Rowe reference! Good luck today and always think safety. That\\'s huge 1600? What you picking at what radius? What‚Äôs the rent on that bad boy? Sweet! Sounds like a fun job to be a part of, big cranes are big fun I\\'m a traffic control supervisor, working in some shady areas in the greter  Sacramento area. My flaggers are threatened by the driving public and pedestrians walking through the job site daily. Yesterday one pedestrian said he was going to get his gun and shoot all of us for holding him at a cross walk. So this is nice to see and I very much do appreciate it. Thanks for the acknowledgement!  I‚Äôm an equipment operator and having a good flagger/spotter is a godsend.  Had a jobsite in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic. When we had trucks enter/exit, we\\'d control pedestrian traffic at the gate by holding plastic chains across the sidewalk on either side. I\\'ve seen people literally duck under the chain and almost get run over. I understand the sentiment, but I don\\'t really understand the picture. Is it supposed to be a memorial or something? I just don\\'t get it. While it is well paying, flagging traffic is crazy dangerous due to all the knucklehead pricks on our roads today.  People in general think this a mindless job but you can sure tell a good flagger from a bad one, which to me means it is anything but mindless. Thanks for keeping us safe! I never really thought of the ever present danger with simply controlling the access to the jobsite. Good post.  As a former intern I enjoyed the power of stopping traffic for safety reasons  Scary stuff for real.   I flagged a bit back in the day and as boring as it was you always had to be on your toes.  Had a little old lady screech to a halt about 10 feet from an open sewer trench roughly 12\\' deep.   Took her that long to realize the gas pedal wasn\\'t the brake!   We\\'ve had several accidents/deaths here in Oregon this summer and it\\'s really scary to read about.   Stay safe out there!! I have been around that loop. Is that circle center in Indy? Thats fuckin unsafe I mean I don\\'t essentially care about work safety but this is a bit too much. Appreciate your work though. Always chew gum when in a crawlspace. That way you can reinforce those weak joints on the way to your destination! Obviously. Look at the all the support nails ! Those are shear proof fasteners.  You\\'ll be fine. You may want to put an extra spike in that one. Looks a little sketchy to me.... So long as you are crawling and not climbing... That piece of wood looks 2 mm thick Trailer? Well, apparently safe enough to post on reddit... Needs another staple, then you\\'ll be safe. That passes code The space appears to be well lit, so it must be OSHA approved Totally SHINER This picture gives you no perspective of what the hell is going on, so my answer is \"I don\\'t know.\" Research confined space safety. What happens if you have  a heart attack there?  Break a leg. How do your coworkers get you out?   Where ever you work , you need to think about what could happen , and how do you get to safety. My wife is trying to get me to stop working right now.  I\\'m in western MA. But all my subcontractors are showing up, I\\'m showing up, the client wants us to show up. We are just dirty construction workers.... No one cares if we get sick and die....get back to work Can anybody‚Äôs workforce‚Äôs afford to sit on their asses for 2 weeks is a better question.  I know a lot of our guys live paycheck to paycheck. I am a small business, I can cover this up to a certain point but after that it is going to have to be back to work.  I hope they come up with some sort of subsidy for people who can‚Äôt get paid  during this period Going hard in SF. Working 6-12‚Äôs. Can‚Äôt build elevators from home haha. No union meetings and I think they cancelled our apprenticeship classes for a while.   Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if things start slowing down though. I work for one of the big 5 elevator companies so  could see them being more careful than the smaller shops. In the end I suppose it‚Äôs up to the GC.  Stay safe and wash your hands brothers and sisters. In Seattle, we are still going.  Traffic is great. Lol if we stop doing our trade then the builder will just bring in someone else. Our client asked for any potential materials that could be delayed and mitigation efforts if we have to shut down for two weeks. My project is nearly done so luckily I have no concerns about materials not showing up but there is plenty of labor to do through August. Being that this is a school project...kind of forced to get it done in time for the start of the school year. I don‚Äôt know if this has been mentioned anywhere, but are our employers required to pay us if the country as a whole goes into a quarantine?  Slightly worried about that. We do interior finish out work in high rises, we\\'re discussing strategies with building management if there\\'s a significant risk inside the building. I work in the AV industry; we have had lots of clients cancel appointments. I‚Äôve only worked two days this week and one day last week. New baby comes this weekend and I‚Äôm screwed financially atm Right now i\\'m working a project in the international terminal of a major airport and no one as of yet has even hinted at shutting the project down.  In fact they are on our ass daily about how long it\\'s taking... Sorry dude, you can only go so fast when you work hours for welding and making noise are from 10pm to 430am. I\\'m an estimator and have underlying health issues and was just told today to work from home through March. These are weird times. We had our monthly safety meeting this morning but also talked about CV. My job depends on the metal market, so far the stock market is holding okay on metal prices. Obviously, we‚Äôre not going to be shipping anything internationally and there‚Äôs not a huge market for it nationally right now. I rarely come in contact with people since I‚Äôm an equipment operator. They said we‚Äôll continue to work and see what happens but anyways I could care less about myself since I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs and relatively healthy. What I‚Äôm worried about though, are my parents who are in their mid 60‚Äôs which they‚Äôre also healthy but dad works in a major hospital and mom works with children and my girlfriend and her family live overseas very close to Asia. Here‚Äôs to hoping everything will pass very soon. Still out here in mi doing siding. On lake st Clair today I\\'m in the process of billing everything we have open right now in the event of inevitable shut downs. It\\'s extremely concerning in the construction industry, especially when you consider the fact that the median age of a construction worker is older than many other industries. I run a water jet for a glass fabrication factory that mainly provides things like shower doors and enclosures for new construction. I received my orders via email. I usually get about 20 to 40 a day. In the last two days I\\'ve had one and that was yesterday morning. Absolutely nothing today. Still going strong in NC. Was just having this conversation and I‚Äôm honestly not sure what is going to happen. I can do probably 60% of my job from home the rest being field supervision. On a very high profile job where time and public eye are the biggest factors, I can‚Äôt imagine anyone would just go ghost on the job. There could be a specific outbreak throughout the entire construction industry and our bosses would still threaten to fire us if we took a day off because ‚Äúshit man I come in when IM sick, so idk what your problem is man if u don‚Äôt want to be here go work at Wendy‚Äôs‚Äù. I work for New Englands largest HVAC and plumbing wholesaler and as of this morning we have cancelled all customer/ employee trainings as well as counter day gatherings I‚Äôm a superintendent for a large scale renovation of a pathology lab in a major state university hospital that just announced their first cases of COVID-19. Things have been pretty crazy the last few days, really ramping up. However, we are not shutting down yet, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs on the table for next week. There‚Äôs word they might be utilizing the exhaust fans we were in the process of demo‚Äôing to help set up temporary isolation containment units for the expected influx of patients. So that‚Äôs interesting. I\\'m in PA but I already work from home, I\\'m just waiting for the email that says to stay home from all job sites, we are allowed to take up to 10 days off if we live in an area that is a quarantine area, but I do not We have two projects in senior care facilities all work has been suspended. One we only had a few rooms left and punchlist to complete now who knows how long until we will be able to finish I run a small home remodeling business and all my interior jobs are being pushed back. Luckily I have a few exterior jobs in the meantime.  I will also be ordering all my materials for delivery as soon as I can. We‚Äôre building a Commons building for the university of Denver. The university is going to online classes for a while, but we have no plans of shutting down. We\\'ve had PM\\'s screening workers for COVID-19 before they enter sites. They were joking about it only a couple days ago, but now they\\'ve really changed their tune.  &#x200B;  EDIT: and by screen, I mean ask if they\\'ve traveled to any of the high risk areas, or if they are showing symptoms. There are no tests. Working in NE on a hospital, I\\'ve been home for a few days now. The site is still going strong, but I showed up with a little cough and they told me to take the rest of the week off. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if we get shut down entirely though in the next week. As of right now no way.  Doing a water bureau job and it‚Äôs kind of a unspoken thing lingering but no one wants stop working.  I mean I‚Äôm fine with it if they deferred all my bills but until then we‚Äôll be on site everyday.  Kind of have to I do so love this industry- usually it‚Äôs the brickies that are fucking whiners - this now seems to have spread.  Every company and owner I have worked for in NE (healthcare & higher ed) have valued and thanked the trades for doing what they do.  So perhaps you need to look for a new line of work in this industry.  Your issue is not with the client or owner - it‚Äôs with your chicken shit leadership at your own company - they are grinding you all to a knub and blaming the owner.    Owners will do what they are allowed to do - if they want a 10 month job done in 8 months and your leadership signs a contract to that effect who‚Äôs responsible?  They will take jobs that are based in fantasyland by some owner who needs to be educated or some architect who doesn‚Äôt pay attention the to world around them  The GC/CM brings a skill set to the process and that needs to be sought out, respected and valued by all involved.  But instead companies continue to shoot themselves in the foot and screw clients over as far as meeting the clients expectations.  This industry screws itself over and then cry‚Äôs poor as the owners of the company‚Äôs drive their luxury cars to their luxury homes.  It‚Äôs the only industry I know that owners have to hire a 3rd party firm (OPM‚Äôs) in order to deal with the bullshit the GC/CM or the A&E firm is tossing against the wall.  Not even used car salesman are treated with that kind of disdain.  And it‚Äôs all the fault of the construction industry.  Your company - if it had balls would say ‚Äúwe value our employees safety and we are shutting down the job until such time as this force majeure (that should be in your contract with the owner) passes.‚Äù  But they don‚Äôt - why is that? Cash flow?   You betcha - luxury cars and houses don‚Äôt pay for themselves- your sore back pays for it.   As my favorite Jamaican labor used to say ‚Äúain‚Äôt nothing to but to do it.‚Äù  So get back to work! I get this question from guys all the time right now. They say it‚Äôs not safe and we shouldn‚Äôt be working. Then I ask would you be willing to stay home without pay? Then we work.   Ain‚Äôt no way for a company to cover everyone‚Äôs payroll and have everyone shut down not working. What state are you in? My job are still up and running but with a lot of health precautions. My city is still relatively unaffected with only 2 reported cases with a population of 250,000 Thankfully my project is in the punch out stage, so I don\\'t have to interact with many people. Just a handful of guys I point to things at for them to fix. Nope I‚Äôm working through with my company In the uk none in the construction industry are staying at home and if theres one industry that should its ours I‚Äôm still working, I don‚Äôt plan on stopping because I need the money, so hopefully sites don‚Äôt get shut down California here, working on the freeway. Headquarters in San Francisco. Caltrans don‚Äôt care about CV, they want us to keep working..... I‚Äôm currently on a hotel project. The buildings occupancy has really died down since the start of all this. A lot of big conferences/shows here have been canceled and rooms are empty. The GC announced in the meeting if it keeps going the way things are there is a high probability that the project gets shut down. I know our big yearly union meetings canceled but the job sites are still active My job hasn‚Äôt stopped yet but I work for myself. If there comes a time when people aren‚Äôt leaving their homes at all then I will be forced to stay home too. Waiting for the job site to open rn We have a job at a hospital here in N.C. and it has been postponed until further notice. Working in central London, public transport is noticeable quiet. Its FANTASTIC!!! Rumors are someone was showing symptoms at Mile Long Bridge in Willow Springs near Chicago. That project may be delayed. I work for a large GC on a site with 700+ people...talks about shutdowns have been ongoing, we have to have an official shutdown plan prepared by the end of day tomorrow.  We have hired second shift cleaners to sanitize all handrails/doorknobs etc.  Everything is escalating very quickly.  All it would take is 1 person presumed positive to shut the whole thing down.  Thats what we are preparing for, and what I personally am expecting. I‚Äôve got no updates on my projects shutting down, but I work in the office and we received an email today saying we‚Äôre testing out working from home tomorrow and Monday. If I had to bet we‚Äôre going to start shutting down job sites in the next month or so Desk job guy here. I still have to come into work but I‚Äôm not allowed site visits at this time Lol That‚Äôs what we are waiting for now. We‚Äôve already had 2 shit weeks with rain and jobs pushing, and if one of the big GC‚Äôs we work for decides to shut down for 2 weeks, we‚Äôll have almost 0 revenue in March. Interesting times. Boss man keeps paying me and I‚Äôll show up. I work in NYC, I\\'m more worried about mass transit shutting down than my site lol I am afraid this will happen to me in a couple of weeks , the company I work for will only last like a month at most without production We are GCs for the Houston based apartment industry. It\\'s a bit slow but there is work to be done. Earlier this week we painted 30 + units . For different buildings obviously We have a job site standdown this Friday to \\'talk about\\' the virus, symptoms and how to treat them. Yah this sounds like a great idea, lets stuff 150 tradesmen on a single floor after coffee break. FFS I‚Äôm from Croatia. Most of materials are coming from Italy, which is blocked now, so we are starting to slow down.  I have team of 6 workers plus me, and we live in an apartment literally 100 meters from construction site. We will keep working till we have materials. I know everybody thinks about corona now, but if it continues for a few more weeks it will trigfer recession and then we are in shithole, we will beg for work then, and stupid investors will just hold on to money. Some of our work in Washington at a major employer is shut down I\\'m a pipefitter in UT and I\\'m all outta work.. just enough savings to last maybe a month Not because of the Coronavirus, but I just got diagnosed with the flu this morning. Sent home for a mandatory four day period. I pleaded with my boss to let me stay and work but he refused to let me. It\\'s apparently a new policy that started because of the Coronavirus. Just cut your leg off Use mineral oil, rub it in to the tar and use a rag to wipe with off as you go. You don‚Äôt dude it‚Äôs just apart of you now Diesel fuel will also work Feathers usually work. What the fuck are you wearing on your feet First stages of Grayscale? Why were you not wearing high boots and pants? Gasoline is your best friend at this point. It‚Äôll work quick I promise. Oof bad luck Chuck Dear God mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, not sure if goo gone is safe for skin contact but thats what i use to get the tar off my vehicles WD-40 believe it or not. GoJo and Dawn. Use some feathers to wipe it off. gas or diesel work really well +1 for gasoline If you don‚Äôt mind, rub it with layer thinner, but rinse off with water asap so it doesn‚Äôt mess up your skin A roofer once told me they use mayonnaise when they get hot tar on their skin. Wd-40, gasoline, or paint thinner Legs are now refurbished and clean. Who woulda thought, sunflower oil. Thanks guys. Too broke to give you all gold but keep it in your hearts you helped a kid get clean before a huge dinner party tomorrow. Thanks! My husband says kerosene. Lestoil is some orange oil stuff that works pretty good for most tar I‚Äôve used Acetone to remove it from clothes and skin without issue before. I‚Äôve had luck with butter taking off acoustic seal, so maybe that will work you wont Where pants next time You don\\'t. Thumbnail made it look like a sick tattoo. Just leave it on haha Looks like you have some good alternatives here so I\\'ll add this in retrospect:   Blood.  Sweat.  And tears. Try Mineral Spirits and a tooth brush WD-40 will get it off Naptha? Acetone Carb cleaner. I got two lots of news for ya, good and bad. The good news is, one leg is no longer going to be tar covered OR hairy. The bad news is, you gotta slather foundation tar on that other leg. Gasoline works great .  just keep rubbing in in and wiping it off . Don‚Äôt smoke while you do this Tell everyone it\\'s just a small spider bite or something else. Have fun with it that\\'s my advice haha Start by throwing away your tom‚Äôs WHAT ARE THOSE  !!!!!!!!!!!! Super clean, diesel, goo gone, acetone. All the stuff you don‚Äôt want on your skin Buy contractors solvent/orange cleaner. I\\'m a roofer :P Anything oil based Are you a hobbit? Fast orange and mineral spirits. Alternate with scalding hot water in between. How‚Äôs about canola oil? In general engine degreaser will get most water proof products. That shit has saved me a lot of scrubing Wax on... Wax off.  Vegetable oil. Gasoline will work best. Actually, paint thinner will work best, but its not very good for you.  Welcome to waterproofing! Time The same way you got it on there, but reversed. Did u try WD-40 ?  Also I pray to allah to have mercy on you Bro you need to get that shoe off your foot & buy a pair of nikes or something Paint thinner is pretty effective, but it‚Äôll irritate the crap out of your skin. You‚Äôll still have to scrub so just expect to have a raw leg Diesel fuel and burn ya leg off works on my rake Amputation. Gasoline works magic on tar but be careful no sparks or open flames while doing it otherwise you\\'ll turn into sonic in a flash lol Brake cleaner Just blowtorch the tar off! It\\'ll melt quickly, along with your ability to use your leg and your sanity. I used to be a hot tar roofer. Yeah, I remember that.. day.   Mitch Hedberg WD-40 would probably work WD-40 F Petrol Baby oil is great for scrubbing it off without also scratching up your leg. Coconut oil and soap! Gasoline White spirit will break down any bitumen based product Xylene Gasoliiiiinna! you dont Fire Burn it?  Edit: were you trying to paint your leg? Feathers work nicely. Gasoline Gasoline is the way to go Bleach. here\\'s what you do:  vote for Medicare For All,  and you won\\'t have to turn to Reddit for medical advice.  F\\\\*\\\\*k Trump I sit in my tower crane far away from everyone Because  nobody gives a s*** about dirty construction workers We\\'re shut Down in Washington state, most of us 1-3 man crews building houses wish they were working...  Especially small business owners I\\'m thankful to not only be working, but even getting overtime to go with it. That being said, the project were working on is an expansion/remodel on a hospital so I do feel a slight bit essential. I found an old half squashed N95 mask in my trunk I‚Äôve been wearing for a week now As someone who has never worked construction, I would not know that construction workers are still working if I didn\\'t get that information from you folks. I admit that I just joined this sub to see my childhood toys come to life, but you are real people being purposefully erased from the public eye and that\\'s fucked up. Most essential workers are to keep individuals alive.  Construction workers are to keep the economy alive.   Shutting down construction also hurts the entire supply chain.  Logging, mines, manufacturers, refractories, developers, contractors, GCs, owners, suppliers, etc.  These aren‚Äôt minimum wage industries, good paying jobs in high dollar industries that pay a lot in taxes. I spray sunblock when working in the sun In NY the Governor shut down non-essential construction. So hospitals and infrastructure projects are still going. You just have to \"try\" and maintain social distancing. Our job, affordable housing in SF is doing a good job constantly sanitizing all floors and stairwells throughout the day (they hired additional labor just for this), stairwells are whither up or down travel, two to the man lift.   As a company we are sanitizing tools, working separate and social distancing at break. I‚Äôm an elevator constructor so we‚Äôre pretty separated from the rest of the other trades for the most part. Our site JUST released a plan. Washing stations on floors, hand sanitizers at elevators, distancing. Real nice to do it now In Michigan it\\'s not, we\\'ve been out of work for a couple weeks now.  I got on unemployment, but just recently picked up a temp job instead to keep me busy, but I\\'m a strange duck and I\\'m in a fairly safe area--low population very few cases etc. I agree wholeheartedly, what we are building is not essential, we are being exposed to a \"known hazard\" unnecessarily and unlike some of the bigger jobs there is nothing being done to mitigate that hazard on my job. I have suggested that we set up some wash basins where a guy could properly wash his hands, I have suggested that we pour some bleach in our Hudson sprayers and disinfect the site and commonly used tools and lifts and I have suggested that we start running split shifts to help guys socially distance but it only led to me getting an earful from the superintendent.   This is a crock, safety is a joke. Wow they give you masks on your site? Must be nice.... Michigan construction got shutdown unless the job deemed essential Because you guys don\\'t make Unicorn Lattes for their writers. I work commercial construction in Canada-mostly grocery stores so I get we are somewhat essential. We are the GC so there‚Äôs been some challenges. But we got pumped water hand wash stations, upped porta potty cleaning, wipe down our tools, disinfect common areas (doors, handrails, etc), instructed our trades to do so as well, ensure social distancing, limiting site to 50 workers, have 2x weekly Covid briefings.  I am struggling to find cleaning products and PPE that is necessary for my guys to do their jobs. I have been able to provide nitrile gloves, hand sani, and 1/2 mask respirators.  I will say that the cooperation and camaraderie that we have built up on our site has helped a lot though! With the fact that all we can do is work and go home and stay home, it‚Äôs nice to have a great team. I said that a second Hawai‚Äôi home for a non-resident wasn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and quarantined myself. Construction trade associations and lobbyists have a lot of pull right now in many states and they want to keep the workforce in place. It took us a decade to catch up to pre 2009 recession workforce numbers and they refuse to let us our workforce dwindle again if they can prevent it. Still building condos in southern California.  We apparently have a housing crisis here and have been told that\\'s the reason. Not sure we are building affordable housing though üòÇ We are essential as we are keeping the economy going by fixing a housing shortage. That is what I found out why I can keep my business going right now. I think that might change as soon as this week. We have people dropping out of their contract. A larger electricial company told me three of their 20 neighborhoods they are wiring have shut down. So prepare yourselves if you living in a high effective area like I do. They are saying end of June before they would consider even opening our state. Go to Home Depot and see all the people Black Friday shopping and you would think everything is fine. Not sure why so many people can\\'t grasp the severity of the situation, just stay home and we can get through this a lot quicker. In California we‚Äôre still building everything. I wonder if they just don‚Äôt want more people unemployed. Imagine how much bigger of a shit the economy would be taking if another 7.5mil people weren‚Äôt working. It doesn‚Äôt make it right, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve been thinking. At least you‚Äôre getting masks. We get nothing unless we provide it ourselves. Our GC brought in 1 ‚Äúhand washing station‚Äù for 60 guys funny thing is, it‚Äôs not hooked up to anything because there‚Äôs no water to the project yet! We razed hell here in Ontario messaging our premier and unions demanding shut down of non-essential sites. Got the message through and most workers last day was the 3rd. Only sites open now are hospitals and the likes. /r/ABoringDystopia Here in NYC I\\'m home collecting $1100 a week unemployment because 90% of construction has been deemed non essential I can think of multiple hazards on any given job site that are far more likely to kill you than COVID-19. And we should be grateful to still be working. A lot of people I‚Äôve heard complaining are people who just want time off work, I have a coworker who even admitted this. However, time off doesn‚Äôt pay the bills in construction.  You don‚Äôt hear talks about us because we are the people everyone hates, but everyone needs. We make noise, inconvenience people, shut down roads, but when shit goes wrong, or shit needs built, there we are. Also ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always entail huge projects with 100+ workers. It encompasses projects of all types, and emergency repairs of all types (such as infrastructure, plumbing, electric, and so on). Not in US, we have been locked down for 4 weeks and looking forward to getting back out there. But listening to posts like this make me thankful for our governments swift action. (Never thought I would say that) Thankful to be working civil in Colorado. Spend more time in the home office, enough time on site with a mask. Keep 10 feet, don\\'t share equipment - spray it with virucide several times a day.  We\\'re getting more done due to less traffic. Luckily I only have one other person at home, and I think we\\'ve both already recovered from COVID. We are fixing all the people\\'s broken sinks toilets water heaters garage door openers....everything that can break in your house...during quarentine...we fix it    stop buying fucking diy projects shot at home Depot s we can do our own job and stay home    building new homes isn\\'t essential...parts of our jobs are..most arnt....we can\\'t pay fast food workers enough to live yet all of sudden people who prepare shitty fast food and scan barcodes at grocery stores are saints and deserve 90k a year. üôè The people that are working..HAVE to work.  It isn\\'t like any essential business had to shut down.. they got to stay open..you can\\'t say no to your job or thell fire you...I\\'m sure almost everyone wants o be at home ..theyres random businesses that have parts that matter and parts that don\\'t.. sure as fuck don\\'t need icecream and dildos. The only thing standing between me and certain coronavirus is a thin piece of dry-fit cloth these days. I work residential. The site supervisors are supposed to be scheduling properly to keep trades apart, but some trades don\\'t listen. I show up early, and lock all the doors in the house so I\\'m alone. If someone manages to get in, I yell at them until they leave, then rat them out to the super. This week I got two people kicked off the site for the day. Still remodeling bathrooms and kitchens in Idaho (one of the last 4 states to get a confirmed case and among the first 17 to shut down, plus it‚Äôs somewhat rural so it hasn‚Äôt hit us as hard). My boss is taking it seriously after brushing it off at first, my coworker not so much (insists on not wearing a mask and getting in my bubble to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me when I don‚Äôt need help). I wear a mask when I have to get close to people (especially him), otherwise I just try to keep a distance and not schedule our subs on the same day. At least my boss realizes we need to step it up and advertise our compliance with CDC guidelines to get new jobs. Don\\'t be a bitch. Business as usual for the construction boys!   I\\'m so glad to have a job at the moment! WHY people work in office cubicles is beyond me. They will never know 25* watching the sunrise with the safety beep of the lull lifting up materials. Sunset heart hands? Looking at this photo makes me recall.. the smell of coffee and cigarettes.  Red in the morning, sailors take warning. Take care up there.  Do you go through a full safety check each day before going up? Is that time on the clock ? 600 Feet up and you don\\'t even have proper toe board on that railing, wtf Wow what a view! Work safely my friend  How‚Äôs the climb every morning ? You like the Doka system? SCREW THAT!! lol  Whats up with the strange whaler placement on the forms? Trip hazards everywhere. PTE stressing machine, commercial forming, Gerdau, which job is this? You in south Florida right?  Oil rig? Nope. What kind of work do you do specifically? I‚Äôd like to get into something like that but don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd start. Apartments? They seem small but curious. Have a good pour Stay safe guys! Good to see somebody working hard in the mud. I can see you from my house! Is this the job over on Cobb parkway ? 41m Schwin? Good work guys  Does anyone need an architect ?? Tell me more about the green crane thing you got going. Holding the camera right is key in moving up the ladder.  At least you\\'re sitting in a warm truck rather than standing in the cold. Cup of coffee and a good podcast and you\\'re set.  chuck in some earplugs so you don\\'t have to listen to that shit for the next two hours. Look on the bright side, after you finish you will be the best turn bucket disassembler this side of the Mississippi. Unfortunately, you will never be able to use this skill again. Ah, an F-150 dash with a 1/4\" of dust on it, I know this work truck feel all too well. You‚Äôre going to be an apprentice forever if you keep doing your work upside down.  Using power tools to work safer and faster while also being ‚Äòlazy‚Äô.  (Lazy can be good).  Stellar job! Good podcasting time why are you completely disassmbling 245 turnbuckles? Plan your work. Work your plan. Nice Whatcha doing??  This is the meaning of work smarter not harder You steal my truck, fucker? Ford F-150? Easy money  Get a second drill, create a second hook,  set it to spin in the opposite direction to the first drill, hook it into the other end and spin both at once.  Would that work and effectivly double your speed?  Do it by hand. Paid by the hour. Not by the turn buckle.  Maybe y‚Äôall need to see the /s Hahaha, this guy thinks he can get deck boards! Good luck Looks solid, thanks for sharing! Awesome thank you I‚Äôm curious about your process. Are you giving your customer only the estimate letter and invoice? Are you giving them the labor/materials log with the invoice? Thanks This is great, I\\'ll be using this! Thanks! I don\\'t personally have use for it, but I can appreciate how much work has gone into this. Thank you for sharing your hard work! Good shit there. I use Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms a ton. Invoices, quotes, and marketing material for my drone side-gig, and I use Forms for the safety program at work (site inspection checklists, employee evaluations and write ups, tool box talk guides and checklists, etc.) Having all of that easily accessible to everyone via phone browsers is insanely convenient. Nice work! Thank you for the great post! Stop by /r/estimators sometime. Thanks legend. This is great, really great. Needed a Google sheet to do just this instead of rehashing my own half made effort. I\\'m on a govt site right now and they\\'ve locked the door to the main facility with just a skeleton crew in operation for the next 2 weeks, they\\'re literally bringing in supplies and leaving them in an elevator for the crew to pick up separately. The city has shut down all of their offices and have their employees working from home. Meanwhile we\\'re onsite, staying in hotels, having to eat fast food from the drive through because all the super markets are sold out of almost everything and they send all of us letters saying we are essential and if we choose to leave the project it is voluntarily, but we\\'re still on the hook to being completed on schedule. Like WTF? Where is the logic in that? I spoke with my boss today and expressed my concerns, and he said if we feel it\\'s getting too unsafe we should take off, so I think this will be our last week here for the foreseeable future. It\\'s just infuriating that the Gov\\'t will turn a blind eye towards contractors doing their work for them in this situation. Useless 3 minute \"stretch and flex\" every morning? Check.  Harness up any time I am over 4 feet on a ladder? Check. Kevlar god damned sleeves any time I am working above ceiling grid? Check. Stay home during global pandemic? Get fucked, buddy. Sucks to be a construction worker right now.  I\\'m fairly lucky that I personally do small installations where I\\'m usually with just 1 or 2 other guys and we don\\'t need much contact from anyone else.     A lot of construction workers live paycheck to paycheck, and smaller construction companies are also essentially paycheck to paycheck, they can\\'t afford to shut down for even just a week or 2.     Hopefully whatever the government passes eases the burden on this industry, but right now construction sites are ripe for spreading the virus. Take a lay off or furlough. That‚Äôs what our company and union are offering if you don‚Äôt want to work. My job site is crazy clean and following guidelines. I feel ya though man. 10% of my jobsite has tested positive for coronavirus this week. Got me a doctor\\'s note that very politely says ARE YOU FUCKING NUTS and I\\'m staying home  I know the company\\'s gotta keep the lights on, but I\\'m not cool with a 20% chance of being hospitalized for $35/hour Yeah man. I‚Äôve been all over twitter making a stink. I‚Äôve already been interviewed by three journalists. New York is scary as shit right now and i‚Äôm building luxury condos that billionaires will rent to millionaires. It‚Äôs amazing how the GCs here seem to be doing nothing and my foreman acts like your some pussy because all of a sudden your production drops because you are not ok with not washing your hands after going the bathroom now.   Fucking stay safe. All of yous. As a equipment operator I WILL RUN YOUR ASS OVER IF YOU GET WITHIN 10 FEET OF ME. This is crazy, people on here faulting OP for choosing their health and life over money/a job. You know this thing is bad when the Chinese decided to shut down their country and hurt their economy temporarily. Their gov doesn\\'t normally care that a few hundred or thousand die. Not sure if this will help, but I wrote this because I have some similar thoughts:     Most employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  Most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  The administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  Stopping work as a safety decision due to Covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  Due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, It is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  Peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the Covid-19 virus around...   Since a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  Being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  This would include at a minimum:   1. Provide necessary PPE (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment) 2. Provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces  3. Look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.) 4. Crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other. 5. Consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. 6. Allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (This may require more time)  I assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  There are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  These scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.  The first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  Along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  Our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  We don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.    To conclude, as a last approach, I will stop work if I don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  While a lot of things are uncertain, I find that it is **PART** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.    This is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  Just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. I work for a GC and I‚Äôm low enough I‚Äôm not making any calls about shutdowns but I hear the conversations with the owners. It bothers me so much that the only thing that gets discussed is how long will delays be and how much will it cost. I have not once heard a single owner or my own company discuss whether or not it‚Äôs safe for the guys in the field to keep the sites open. I can‚Äôt believe as much as every acts like safety comes first that it‚Äôs not a bigger part of the conversation.   Construction is essential is a fucking joke. Essential for what? The economy. You can always ask for a lay-off. Same thing in Ohio for me currently. Our state shelter in place order lists certain types of construction as essential but it\\'s extremely vague. It\\'s complete bull shit because there\\'s a lot left open to interpretation that companies seem to be using as a loop hole to leave all sites running like normal. I wish higher up execs would have the balls to tell clients to shut down truly non-essential sites. For example, I\\'m building a new cafe in an existing office building, real essential..... I‚Äôm kinda curious to know what you mean by toxic masculinity. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from just hang in there and be safe Im working in Chicago ,contractor I work for cut down crews by the bunch and completely shut down some jobs . Only 1 allowed in the elevator at a time drags getting up and down My jobs site in the California Bay Area is shutdown right now.  We got sent home the moment they ordered shelter in place. It‚Äôs a union job building a parking garage so maybe it‚Äôs not essential work, I‚Äôm not sure when we‚Äôre going back. I personally can‚Äôt see us staying shutdown too long because time is money. Today California officially titled construction essentials work too so that might change things. I do commercial stuff. Like maybe one part of one of my projects gets to stay open right now. Got a call from a painter earlier... I dont think hes essential. Did you seriously bring up toxic masculinity? I don\\'t think construction is the right industry for you... Just tell your boss your going into voluntary isolation.    The people at fucking whataburger are still working, the people at circle K are still working,  the people at Amazon are still working ‚Äî you‚Äôll be fine.    Talk to my bartender about this because she‚Äôd probably suck a cock for $200 at this point We are building an abortion clinic right is that essential lol glad guys are walking off the job Shut up pussy It is essential. You should be happy you still have a job and can work. [deleted] You don‚Äôt like it or scared go home there‚Äôs a bunch of ppl currently without work who are hoping daddy government is going to give them money to get thru the next couple months.  Be grateful you have work because there‚Äôs probably a million or more people who would love a chance to earn money right about now. I 4 one am very happy that Florida hasn\\'t shut down, I like most construction workers I know spend it as fast as I make it. Idiot. You Americans seem very scared of this virus, perhaps it\\'s your culture, you guys seem to love the idea of a doomsday.   Might be your lack of universal healthcare, with that said many people are scared in Sweden too. [removed] I lost my best friend to suicide 10 years ago. He was in the construction industry. Here is some more information because the more we talk about it, the more we can prevent it. And yes. It really sucks to walk up to a guy on the crew and ask if he\\'s in a dark place. But hell, we\\'re building nations. We do tough shit every day. We can help prevent the next death.   RESOURCES  Warning signs: https://afsp.org/about-suicide/risk-factors-and-warning-signs/  For workplace leaders: http://www.constructionworkingminds.org/  General information and more resources: https://preventconstructionsuicide.com/  OSHA\\'s page: https://www.osha.gov/preventingsuicides/ Honest question if we could reduce insurance cost would the employers hire more employees and reduce OT? I love this industry but I also love my friends and family and would like to see them more  but you cant do that working 70+ a week  Edit* Clarification that I‚Äôm implying better work-life balance could help reduce suicides The amount of men I see living paycheck to paycheck while making $55/hr would make most people shit their pants. Thanks tomorrow mornings safety talk is now changed to mental health check. My crew and I are a tight knit group and I know including my self 4 of us all have a close family member that died by suicide.   These are some strong stats.    Stay safe out there guys and gals both physically and mentally. And yet Reddit has this obsession with suggesting the trades over college.  I knew a guy with COPD who was still doing residential carpentry in his 60s. He offed himself with a shotgun a few years ago.  This industry breaks as many people as it makes. Be smart out there, guys. Well I was kinda excited for work tomorrow. Not so much now The work-to-life ratio definitely has a heavy hand in failing mental stability. My husband and I never see each other, and we\\'re not truly \\'travelling\\' yet. On the one hand, we\\'re damn near back to the honeymoon phase of our marriage because we\\'re apart so often and are genuinely excited to be together again. On the other hand, even though we work in the same state and live together, it gets painfully lonely because we work on opposite ends of the state and no one is ever home to keep up the house or make hot meals at that. We live off of sliced deli meats in coolers.  I always try to ask questions about wives and kids while I\\'m working with travelling guys. Ask to see pictures, etc. Bring up happy reminders of home, cause I\\'ve definitely met a few who had that soulless look in their eyes. Going home for a week every 3 months has gotta be soul-crushing. Shit, going home every night but having a 2-hour commute each way is soul-crushing.  I love working in construction. The work is satisfying and one day I\\'ll make decent money, lol, but the time you have to spend away from home and loved ones is where the whole thing falls apart. You know what the biggest cause of deaths in construction is?   Suicides  Construction suicide rate is 4x the national average and is the leading cause of construction fatalities. Construction is #1 in suicides per year and #2 in suicide rate per year.   &#x200B;  Talk to your guys. Get a jobsite counselor if you are on a large job.   &#x200B;   [https://www.cfma.org/suicideprevention](https://www.cfma.org/suicideprevention) Remember to tell your boss NO if something, like say putting a ladder up next to a open pit, doesn\\'t seem safe to you.   Your life is not worth his production schedule and unless he likes phone calls from OSHA inspectors I\\'m sure he\\'d be glad to find another way.  I bet that guy is notorious for dropping drills. Typical. That is not how I thought that was going to go tits up. This is so perfectly unfortunate.  The way that board threads it\\'s way into the ladder at the end is amazing. 100% dipshittery. All around. He ded Next week‚Äôs safety topic with video. Thanks! That cordless was going to survive until he threw it Where the arrest fall bags at? i‚Äôm takin ya with me bitch Even if your a skywalking-ninja-prince of Persia?? Please god tie the fuck off! It‚Äôs there for the .1% chance you think will never happen. We work in a field that it nothing but dangerous and eventually something is going to go wrong... protect yourself also make sure you are using the right equipment PROPERLY My Forman (my dad) fell off the other day. Tied off harness clipped in. He was undoing the tarps and when he stepped he stepped on the tarp, slid like a pendulum to the edge of the roof and the anchor comes off and FLIES IN THE AIR A GOOD 15 ft. Hits the side of the wall and hits the ground hard (only like a 10 ft fall but enough to hurt) walks it off and gets back to work. Literally the scariest moment on the roof to date. Yes the anchor was on a stud the roof was so rotted that the screws just flew out of the roof. I\\'m waiting for the ring video since it happened right infront of the front door. As some that has had fall pro save my ass.....WEAR IT,  stay tied off, and don\\'t cross over someone else\\'s retractable/lanyard. As well as fall protection, use proper fasteners and techniques if you build scaffold on the side of a house.   True story...   Bro was in the back that day, setting windows with a man we\\'ll call Dumbass. So it was, Dumbass was told to build a scaffold up there so they could place all the windows. Up there. On the second floor.   Sure enough, they were up there, on the second floor scaffold, my brother and Dumbass there, and it went all crashing to the ground.   Bro noticed after it all fell, that there weren\\'t but 8p nails holding everything together...   \"Dumbass, why didn\\'t you use 16p nails?\"    \"All I had on me was the 8p\\'s, so I just used twice as many.\" I guess he can math, he just can\\'t reason.   Bro still complains of the back pain he formed that day, and it\\'s been long enough to have us two more brothers die since. I used to think tying off on a lift was redundant. That was until, while still learning the boom lift, I went off a curb just a touch too fast. I didn\\'t go more than a few inches airborne, but the potential of it hit me immediately. As did the importance of going super slow at crucial times, and wearing that damn harness. The only people that have problems following safety protocols are usually hacks that think they are gods give to us all and are so good. Haha oh man. Don‚Äôt you know all this safety stuff actually makes my job more dangerous? No, it\\'ll stay. It\\'s good sharing info. I\\'ve seen this practice save lives......my own included. I\\'ve seen guys get hurt from it as well. But, they are alive. My gear has saved my ass more than once. Probably a little late to the party with this comment here, but what really enforced tying off for me was seeing one of my older coworkers who could barely walk, hobble around a job site. Guy had fallen about 35 feet onto the ground. Was painful just to watch him take a few steps. It‚Äôs those little tasks where you‚Äôre only going to be by the edge for a few seconds where something goes wrong. Scissor lift? Nah  JLG? Sure I never seen anyone tie off in the years I‚Äôve been working.   I guess that‚Äôs something Union guys do Drunk you says what sober me thinks. I always felt kind of nerdy thinking it though.  Stay safe brah Sitting here at my desk. Wish I was that drunk! Sadly, 7h to go untill I get out!  We love you too man! :) No, seriously. I love YOU üçª Hell yeah brother!  For most people life really is spent at home, working & sleeping. You should value each equally. Work shouldn\\'t just be a paycheck, but unfortunately for a lot it is. This community is mostly the people who take pride in their work. People who are passioniate about their trade. Who clearly spend their extra time of day on work when they don\\'t have to.  Every job is gonna have dramaqueens that wanna take out their problems on you or the slackoffs that cut major corners & give your occupation a bad name. Those that don\\'t care at all about being better. It\\'s not weird at all to appreciate this culture & comradery.  You SHOULD treat your coworkers like family. Doesn\\'t mean you are obligated, I just believe it\\'s a key to inner peace. And you SHOULD love waking up to work. It SHOULD feel like a second home. This kinda stuff has been around since the dawn of the internet, it\\'s pretty aesthetic here particularly imo. Lots of spontaneous fascination posted by cool people & stimulating discussions. This sub is awesome. We love you too, mate. Follow your bliss. Be well. =] CountMeIn I like that this sub captures all types of the industry from PMs, engineers/inspectors, labor and supers/foreman. I‚Äôve learned a decent bit here.   The camaraderie that develops when you spend all day with someone is special. I\\'m just an office guy these days but there was something even more special about working out in the field with the same people day in and out. They really do become your family if you let them. Lunches together, carrying the weight of tough days together, jamming out together - it wasn\\'t always the work, but what the work brought around.   My family has made its livelihood off of a trade and for that, it feels integral to who I am. It\\'s hard not to extend those feelings to anyone else in the trades. It reminds me of being a little boy out with my dad in the field connecting some outdoor lights at a shooting range. I\\'m rambling now too but yeah, I feel it.  Wonder if you‚Äôre just as hungover as I am today. Holy fuck How often you and your Union brothers do circle jerks? Nailed it. I heard you can shoot yourself with smaller gauge nails to build up immunity to larger gauges. Is 15 your next attempt? Noice. At least you didn\\'t nail your balls to your leg. I\\'ve witnessed that carnival.  Hey, uhhhh... your religion is showing...  It happens to the best of us... At least you had on those safety shorts and tennis shoes. Lol.  You just rubbed some dirt on it and get back to work or plan on seeing a doc? Young me was all about option A... Now I\\'m sitting here like, you can get a bad infection from that. lol Stop hitting yourself. Hope you‚Äôre up to date on your tetanus shot. If you don‚Äôt mind could you share the how part....I‚Äôm guessing you were holding the trigger and slipped. G‚Äôs apparently didn‚Äôt protect you! #MormonHumor  My boss has had a similar accident. He didn\\'t even notice shooting himself until he tried to take his pants of. The nail didn\\'t go through the fabric all the way so essentially he had non-removable pants then.  I have just shot a nail through my finger. I was installing a ceiling paneling, the nail did an u-turn on a knot in the wood and came through my ring finger. Had to go to the ER with the panel I was installing. Ahh the old fast food napkin plus blue tape bandage, then when the blue tape ripped, it was re-engineered with duct tape.  Congrats! Haha.   Never nailed myself but I‚Äôve stapled myself a few times.  Did it hurt?  Put one in my knee in front of my boss and the super of our job a few years back, take it easy on walking, gonna be reaaaaaal sore  Don‚Äôt worry about it. I shot a 3‚Äù paslode galvy ring shank through my hand into some decking. Nailed myself to the roof. I‚Äôll try and find the picture.   Edit: here is the [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qa0i29u)   Story time: My boss had to split the piece 1- 1/2‚Äù of decking around the nail and this was right before we snipped the nail back. It didn‚Äôt quite penetrate my middle finger on the other side of the wood but it left a mark. I was working on a small island off Vancouver Island and there was no hospital so we went to a medical clinic and ended up having two small old ladies pull it out in an aggravatingly slow manner. The rings in the nail did their job in the flesh. It wasn‚Äôt actually as painful as you‚Äôd think, just more of a pressure type pain. Oh and the reason it happened: I was using a framing gun with a bump trigger In my left hand ( I‚Äôm right handed) and the gun bounced after I shot the decking and landed on my hand. It took me awhile to live that one down on site but was back to work light duty within 2 days. I was told it was a right of passage and honestly was surprised how many people had done something similar. Be safe out there folks! Yes it going to be super sore as mentioned  When you move up to circular saws then you can brag This makes me very thankful to be in the office designing the trusses rather than framing them. Lol  Ah duct tape, the job site ‚Äòtussin.  That will be sore AF in the morning. Count your self lucky.  The last person that posted a shot myself with a nail gun got his knee.   Fuuck haha looks like it fuxking hurt! A coworker of mine got himself with a sheathing nail right through the 2nd knuckle of his left index. His finger was bent in a v shape at the time so the nail went like this   |----/|--  through the back and out the front. Caught the bottom of the joint on the way by. NASTY and took a lot of therapy. Was fat for years.  Worst I got was hacking that same knuckle to the bone with an angle grinder. Hurt like a bitch for months. Wouldn\\'t want a nail to the thigh! Title was sarcasm  Needs more wire nuts O Yeah. That‚Äôs safer then smoking in bed!!!  Sub panel is especially clean. Would hire this homeowner. I love air splices! Y\\'all should recognize what is going on in this photo and stop the circlejerk.  The panel on the left is the old panel, with maybe 100A main. The panel on the right is a new panel with maybe a 200A service. If you look in upper right of the new panel, you will see the completed circuits; they look fine. The \"air\" connections are temporary to allow the homeowner to keep power while the new panel is being wired.  What the hell is wrong with you guys, are you really this dumb? The only code he needs to worry about is Hammurabi\\'s Code. Who needs a junction box Codes are just a guideline or a suggestion.  Oh sweet baby Jesus.  What are those mains just hanging there to the left of the junction box!? Thank you for this. I truly needed to laugh & cry at the same time today. Not even close.  Welcome to the real world Better then some professional jobs I seen I would say that its an abomination and it needs to be killed with fire but I think that it will take care of itself... Yeeeeaaaaahhh... That\\'s called a fire hazard. Everyone out! Should be located below the hose bib shut offs, in case of fire I rented from this dude  Turn and walk away Need a professional electrician, LED lighting  design,supply and installation, solar panel installation as well, digital signage (Mall, shops), even for Christmas lighting sculpture please send an email to inq.goh@outlook.com  Any gypsum and construction job,please let me know.  We are an international company base in Germany.  Lol. Why are you even asking? This is pure trash One time my dad nailed a baseboard in a finished house and pierced a bottle of piss in the wall. The piss all leaked out on the finished floor and stunk up the place. I was part of an adaptive reuse of an old high rise factory into 150 apartments - I\\'ve never seen so many piss bottles on a job.  My favorite bottle, by far, was on an exterior window sill on the top floor in a corner unit.  The windows were fixed and three was just enough piss that the bottle wasn\\'t moving.  It was too high to reach with a lift.  We ended up having to scaffold the entire face for an unrelated issue and, thank God, someone grabbed the bottle.  I think we all know who is responsible for this most of the time. Paying workers piece work should not be allowed. It is unsafe and creates a need to piss in bottles Construction manager for a large GC here. If I catch you doing that you are fucking fired and will never work on one of our projects again. Disgusting fucks, use the dozens of porto-johns we rent for you.  I don\\'t understand this. I\\'ve never asked my parents or anyone in my life for permission to go to the bathroom. I go. If you want to fire me over it, go the fuck ahead, but never will i ask. And i don\\'t bother with piss bottles.. If my employer cannot provide me with a proper bathroom, i\\'ll leave the jobsite and use the closest one and come back. piss bottles are only applicable until the bathtubs are installed  I work in the industrial side of construction and we really don\\'t have this problem. Our \"problem\" is people smoking in the port-a-cans.   After saying that, I was laid off for a few months and a buddy asked if I could help out on this new apartment complex they were building. They client changed their mind about the single room apartments and wanted only a standing shower instead of a tub. So we were there to take them out. We removed about 40 tubs and every single one on the 3rd floor and up had been pissed in. The 4th floor was the worst. There was no  A/C and this was in July in Louisiana. After the job, I thanked my buddy but told him I would never do that again.  We have had to put up signs for pissing and spitting.   As a girl, when I moved from pre-construction bids to be a fit out manager on site I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd have to hold my breath as much as I do when walking around dark, small plantrooms.  Shit we had a fully functional restroom with running water and flush toilets and urinals.... was on L1 of a high rise Reno... as soon as we started L4 piss bottles everywhere  We did a condo on the 17th floor of a high rise where there was no toilet in the unit for about a week. I found a bucket, a fucking five gallon bucket that was about half full of shit and piss tucked under the master vanity.  if you piss in a bottle, throw it in the bin.  Avoid the fire stairs at all costs How about the drywallers who piss in the glue tubes and shit in the mud boxes. A general picked up one of the tubes once and spilled piss on his hand. He was livid. Lol I had capped a 4\" soil pipe,  built a large set of concrete stairs on top of the pipe end and 2 months later as the job was finishing, had to cut out a channel and put some surface drainage in. I could smell piss. Piss everywhere. I\\'m pretty junior so thought I had fucked up the capping. Was ready to fire up the core drill / still saw to expose my \\'mistake\\' when the plasterer told me my filthy fuck joiner had been pissing in there every day. The main future entrance door to a residential property. Fuck that guy, and fuck the 40lbs of pissy sand I had to dig out and bag up.  Working in multifamily this is just the norm, no matter how many portapotties I have on site Do you all of your jobs not pay for Porto potties? WTF? People also like to piss in electrical stub outs on big jobs.  I blasted some serious air into a 3\" conduit with a 50hp compressor one day. Turns out someone was pissing into the other end at the same time.   I was told that the guy ran out from behind the building gagging, without his hat and, soaked from the knees up. I can only hope that he was the first to piss in that particular pipe and that the rest was just water...   Buuuut let\\'s be serious, it was a big job and those stubs were in a prime pissing location. Without being racist..... Asians. Thats why the companys over here are in charge to put up Toilets.  And because they know ppl are lazy..  http://atlastoilets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Urinal-on-wheels-PeeOne.jpg  like this one, can be used nearly everythere.  Honestly, it sounds like tour doing a lot in the way of giving things. I would make an effort to make some of your efforts more meaningful. Yes a tumbler is nice, but giving specific examples of why an employee was safe and what that really means can do wonders for morale. Hi, I am currently working on alleviating these problems in construction through technology. Would you mind sharing your experience over a quick call ? >That restaurant had also undergone a fire inspection without a given notice (I think somewhere in between late December 2019 to early 2020) as they had informed me that everything was up to standards. No certification was given to me after the inspection though.  Just to clarify this was done by a fire marshal or inspector? If so try contacting them and asking for some documentation.  Sorry from the US so dont k ow what yoyr requirements are.  I would also suggest asking in r/healthandsafety You would want someone who is qualified to understand the requirements. A firefighter sure could be used to make such an assessment. Create a similar document and have them fill it out along with their qualifications'"

       "'hey man, i feel your pain. my unique problem has been that big sites deciding not to operate has put all of the smaller domestic jobs at the front of the line. which is putting like 25 dudes on my sites that would usually have me and my two guys on. my worksites are getting busier not quieter, australia is going alright atm but i am perplexed at the moment. i was working on a project that was pretty critical. i\\'ve been pulled to a stupid one so a subcontractor can get in that space  i haven\\'t decided if i\\'m going to work today yet & i\\'m supposed to leave in 45 minutes. i really don\\'t know what to do. i won\\'t lose the job if i stay home, but i just came off a long winter lay off. glad to see some people actually share this sentiment. sometimes you gotta say fuck it. my boss said if i don‚Äôt wanna work because of coronavirus can go work at burger king. i‚Äôm in chicago doing completely non essential demo work on a hotel that is being renovated. 10 of us wearing rubber gloves and going through at least 10 n95 masks a day. it‚Äôs honestly sickening that we are still working and wasting resources that could go to protect the people saving lives. i truly hope that after all this, people actually remember the companies that did absolutely nothing to help. told our owner, and my dad (my operator) on our pipe crew that i\\'ll be staying home until the spread is more contained. they started on the line of \"it\\'s one of the safer jobs as far as that goes, what will you do for money, and it\\'s basically you quitting so you won\\'t get unemployment\" i told then that my health, my families, crews, and their health is more important to me than some people more wealthy than them that want houses built. they didn\\'t quite understand where i was coming from, but definitely respect it. remember that\\'s it\\'s up to you to decide when it\\'s safe enough to work (equipment, and conditions). be safe or there guys. the comeback is always stronger than the setback. unless we are building a hospital, a clinic, or re-furbishing an existing factory/plant so that ventilators and other essential ppe can be produced, nothing we do is essential. [deleted] smart, id work for you, my wife is a nurse. ‚Äúhospitals would be too overwhelmed to deal with our injured asses‚Äù  this is what i keep telling people who, now that they are stuck at home with plenty of free time, think it‚Äôs a good time to take up hiking and think a 4/5 difficulty 8 mile trail is a good starting point.   when they go out and snap an ankle or fall down a hill, it will be my volunteer search and rescue team going out, getting exposed and risking our own injuries, and you take up a hospital bed because you watched bear grylls one too many times. i work for a large commercial gc and out of 166 projects across the country, only 7 have been shut down so far. there is no way we have that many essential projects. unfortunately, we can\\'t shut down jobs even if we wanted to since we are bound by a contract. unless the government or the project owners decide to shut down the jobs, then we are on the hook for liquidated damages if we stop work, and the owner\\'s don\\'t want to pay for our extended general conditions so it doesn\\'t seem like they are going to tell us to stop any time soon. absolutely. the super on our job told us to say 6\\' apart. we\\'re standing 12\\' sheets of drywall. there is no way we can stay 1\\' apart, much less 6. it would be one thing if it was actually an essential project (hospital etc), i understand. but even if the project finished tommorow, office workers wouldn\\'t be able to occupy it anyway since they\\'re non essential.  this will go down as one of the biggest failure of gov\\'ts and employers across the world to protect their people. most are more worried about the economy. the first couple weeks unlocking the gates and going into work during the pandemic have been tough. signs everywhere telling you to stay home. people everywhere watching you from windows as you go about your day as if you‚Äôre the walking dead.    i‚Äôve succumb to my fate whatever it be. my only hope is that i don‚Äôt cause illness to my wife or infant son. i do wish the health ministries would shut us down. but the longer this drags on the less likely i see that happening.     keep your social distance they say this will keep the virus at bay. this is unpopular? my company already sent all our masks to the hospital. imagine working on a project for 3.5 years.  finally you\\'re about to finish. all the paperwork, finishes and cleaning is done. you\\'re ready for inspections.  if all goes smoothly, you\\'re due for great bonuses.  then this shit hits the fan. all inspections are cancelled and your ass is furloughed until further notice. southeast (greater atlanta area) and home builders are still going strong.  we build decks and fences for some of the largest nationwide builders.  we had so much rain in jan, feb. that everything is behind schedule.  so they are making up for it now that the weather is dry(ish).  we are also seeing an increase in renovation projects because people are home and want to get their ugly deck replaced.  i just stand 10-15\\' away from the homeowner as they explain what they want done to the deck or fence.  we are fortunate that we build decks and fences and only have 3-4 guys per crew, and they are following the recommended guidelines.  our supplier has closed their showroom, so we can\\'t just show up and pick up material.  we have to call it in ahead of time and they can load it without contact.  are decks and fences essential, no.  but, if the builder can\\'t finish his build-out, then it doesn\\'t pass inspection, doesn\\'t provide shelter for the new owner.  if the virus infection rate doesn\\'t peak soon, i expect we will be shut down.  but until then we are being as safe as possible. i\\'m in a low infection state and our dumbfuck gc pulled a crew from colorado and a crew from washington to our site.  how fucking retarded is that?  of course, the owner and architect don\\'t live here, so why the fuck would they care? if i didn\\'t hate the two of them already, i sure do now. i\\'ve had the same thought.  i\\'m building a carwash in a town in texas... about 3 hours from home.  i\\'d just kind of rather be home.  staying in hotels, having to eat out, and go get supplies puts me around so many more people.  i\\'d rather put everything on pause and wait it out. the owners of our company sent out a fucking joke of a video saying that we will stay strong and get through this. they proceed to tell us to make sure to wear ppe like safety glasses and high vis.   also stay 6 ft apart from your nearest teammate. most od the business is concrete, good luck follwing that rule what if i told you that a few weeks off isn‚Äôt going to be worth a pinch of shit. but a few *months*, or several months is the answer. how would you feel then? because i‚Äôm sorry to say but that‚Äôs the reality mate and you very well might not get the choice in a few weeks. 100%  never mind that we can‚Äôt even get the ppe we need to do our jobs...  and yes, the project i‚Äôm on could wait. i don‚Äôt see how all construction has been deemed essential. i cannot upvote this hard enough.  you have no idea how correct you are about receiving care when you are injured, and the resources it takes up.  let me illustrate a real-life example.  i currently have bilateral inguinal hernias, and they are uncomfortable.  i\\'m a healthcare provider, i work in surgery, and even i cannot get a slot to have them repaired.  i\\'m stuck waiting until after covid passes.  literally all of our resources are being allocated towards covid, as they should be.  will i be uncomfortable waiting, yes.  will i survive?  yes, i\\'ll be fine, it\\'ll just be annoying.  we aren\\'t even doing surgery for slow-going cancer right now...  #stayhomesavelives isn\\'t just a platitude, it\\'s necessary as a society for the survival of many of our most vulnerable members.  your generosity in donating ppe goes further than you can even imagine.  that ppe allows providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, cleaning crews, and even some volunteers, to give everything they have towards fighting covid.  it literally saves lives, and it goes without saying that every life is so, so, valuable. this is an interesting conversation. i have been thinking about this a lot lately. the company i work for is on the smaller side. so it‚Äôs basically a couple guys in a truck. we work outside all the time. we don‚Äôt really interact with anyone besides ourselves and wherever we stop for lunch. so i think for the most part we are ok. but then i had to stop at home depot for a box of screws. and i was completely floored at how many people were in there just wandering around. that‚Äôs where i am having issues. but at the end of it, we build decks. this isn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and we should be home. my exact thought. as someone who does insulation and knowing my company is shut down right now, i truly believe all of our ppe which include nitrile gloves and n95 face masks should all be given to medical staff. just a reminder that some politicians get a good percentage of campaign contributions from contractors. these people aren‚Äôt going to be out their fucking money. fuck that. get the fuck out there and work you expendable fucking nothings. this is who we are to them. could you imagine if just one of us had the power to turn it right back on em? until then my family doesn‚Äôt eat unless i hit my 40 hours and get my shit squared away. fuck our labor and loyalty, fuck our health, and the fuck the health of our family. i‚Äôm a site manager, currently building 180 open market houses and a load of council houses. we closed our site last week, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to carry on.  i struggle to get the guys to wash their hands and respect the toilets as it is - let alone making them work 2m apart and wash hands every 10 mins....  the amount of people that visit the site every day, makes it even more unsafe!   good luck to you! > i just wanna get this over with and stay the fuck at home for three weeks and then go back and take my chances then.   just want to clarify that the entire point of the quarantine is not to ‚Äúget this over with‚Äù by speeding things up. in fact, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. the point of the quarantine is to draw things out and make the pandemic last longer so that the medical system isn‚Äôt overwhelmed all at once; to allow more supplies to be produced/distributed, more coordinated planning to take place. staying home for three weeks is not some magic panacea that makes the issue go away. there is no waiting this out, unless you‚Äôre talking about shutting things down until this time next year when, if we‚Äôre lucky, we will finally have a vaccine developed. life will have to return to some semblance of normal well before this truly passes. the fact is most americans will eventually get coronavirus and most will not even suffer any ill effects. that‚Äôs not to say your concerns aren‚Äôt justified and your site shouldn‚Äôt down. but frankly i‚Äôm just tired of seeing social media posts to the effect of ‚Äúi feel like a kindergartner who keeps loosing more recess time bc one or two kids can‚Äôt follow directions‚Äù that‚Äôs not how any of this works project engineer/superintendent for a big gc here. i 100% agree with you but my company has made it clear that unless a client directs us to shut a project down, it stays open. like the client on my project hasn\\'t even floated the idea of shutting down temporarily even though my state was one of the first to have a shelter in place order. kind of sucks because this customer claims to be \"people friendly\" but yet they don\\'t seem to give a shit about the well-being of the blue-collar, construction workers building their new, precious cafe. i drive a forklift for a home builder in socal working for a nationwide developer.   business as usual here except all the bosses are talking a big social distancing game but in reality ignoring everything.  pouring concrete for the next phase on friday,  dropping lumber on monday and back at it.   i have told others to stay away from me. if you need me call me.  if you try and flag me down i will drive right by.   i\\'m fine going to work,  or staying home.  i just pray we dont, as a business and a trade,  have many accidents wasting valuable resourses at the hospitals. gst as many of your co-workers as you can to stop going in on the same day i\\'m in the same boat, myself. i work for a contractor. i mentioned my worries to my boss about wanting to isolate and stay home for fear of getting everyone else in my house sick. but i do need money. so as for now and the foreseeable future me and the rest of the crew are working alone on solo jobs for my boss on empty rentals or flip houses. i still dont k ow if i should be but i feel it\\'s better than working in our usual crews drag up over concerns for your health. at the next safety meeting, stand up, say so, say the company isn\\'t adequately addressing our health and safety, and walk the fuck out. you\\'ll probably qualify for ue. no i‚Äôm desperate for work rn. my government has denied me all access to support so i have no choice but to work. i\\'m really hoping that one of the older journeyman on site organizes a walkout in the next couple weeks if it gets worse and worse and they dont shut our site down i couldn‚Äôt agree more. i‚Äôm a field superintendent and i don‚Äôt want to call my subs and ask them to work. then the office cock suckers call and get on my case. they are sitting at home on the couch complaining that we don‚Äôt want to work. the only way they will make money is if we are working. heck one of them asked me if i would go run a job out of state starting this month. fuck that. i love this post. thanks for sharing. it‚Äôs comforting knowing other people feel the same. construction can wait. imho if the entire construction industry stopped for the quarantine, especially with the amount of workers that have been employed by it in the recent boom, it will be the last industry to come back online.   the overwhelming amount of unemployment claims is one item, but when the industry actually can restart, it will be slow. this will cause only the experienced workers to be brought back at first and not even all of them. most of the older workers and a lot of the mid level will move out of the industry for something more ‚Äústable‚Äù. the apprenticeships will dry up as well. then we will be stuck with more unskilled tradesmen than experienced ones. it will domino and postpone the next 10+ years of projects. basically it will cripple the industry and result in decades of poorer quality projects.   i understand and your concern and am right there with you. my other major concern is the industry as a whole never really recovering. we still are feeling the shockwaves from the 2008 market collapse and there were large projects still being completed during that timeframe. a complete stop will crush us all.   one item a lot of people fail to see is that if the project cannot get funded, it won‚Äôt proceed. if projects that are currently funded go belly up, it will leave husks of incomplete buildings dotting the skyline. the amount of money and labor needed to recondition or retrofit one of these projects is insurmountable and likely will cause large scale demolitions and multiple, i mean multiple lawsuits, as in a metric fuck ton of lawsuits being filed and undermining the foundation of the industry.   many projects will require cash in hand for the entire project up front. that will scare many to not even begin.   i‚Äôm talking about the construction industry going dark for a decade, at least. but that‚Äôs just my lowly opinion. i hope to hell im wrong. i was talking to my former vp yesterday who does work all over the us. his southern projects are still going strong. most people are working. midwest is pretty well shut down. so far $80 million in work in process and no cv-19.  edit: i was surprised that jobs were still going, but there are a lot of states without mandatory quarantine. i have nothing else to say here except- i like you, man. you‚Äôre a good dude and you make sense. our govorner had all major contractors in the state do an inventory of ppe. almost all companies have halted major upcoming projects and finished the ones they had going on and then stopped the majority of non essential projects. the smaller home contractors are ignoring the sip order and continuing operations. the smaller contractors are the ones who don\\'t have safety training, ppe, or first aid on site. so that\\'s cool. we are not disposable. well said i stopped going on my own it was messing with my head too much   some of our jobs gathered all the dust mask to give to first responders we are the only assholes still working at full manpower levels. 700 men in a site and minimal hygiene resources. the gc and ownership can kiss my ass. commercial hvac foreman in atlanta .  nervous as hell , i am running a job with over 300 plus swinging hammers on site. we all share 25 shiters no paper no soap or water.   as for hand sanitizer or cleaning supply‚Äôs i am not so sure that these things even exist.    the higher ups on the job have all gone to teleworking and all job meetings including stretch and flex and safety meetings have been canceled.   when questioned when are we shutting down the simple answer is not until some one on site tests positive.  i personally don‚Äôt want to be here anymore but i have a responsibility to my team who have decided to work until we can‚Äôt.  please stay safe out there brothers and sisters, my company put out a notice that said that if anyone on a project had symptoms of flu or coronavirus, that job would shut down.  someone on the gc team for my job just got quarantined last night with fever and cough and guess what job site is still open!  next safety manager who tells me i\\'m putting people at risk by leaving an extension cord on the ground is gonna get a fucking earful boston shut down all jobsites per order of the mayor (or governor). unfortunately it takes something like that for those with the deepest pockets to put people over profits. this reminds me of the time i went to an outdoor concert with my wife and she was like ew theseouthouses are disgusting and i\\'m like what? they\\'re the cleanest i\\'ve ever seen. most of them dont even have shit on the seat next to muddy footprints i work for a d/b firm. architects, engineers and others are working from home. meanwhile, i\\'m about 1,000 miles from home. job must be completed on time! all construction sites. they treat us like animals i\\'m a super for a large gc (project is not in nyc or sf) and we are still open.     we are following cdc guidelines, have double cleaning of all areas (including adding a disinfectant fogging of all common areas inc honey pots), keeping track of anybody who calls in, have told people if they want to stay home for whatever reason they can, and have canceled all in person meetings except the morning huddle.  people underestimate how many people are pay-check to pay-check. our guys are happy to have the option to work and not dig into savings.     we are making sure we are tracking who is out sick for whatever reason. if it jumps, we will shut down. we already shutdown one day and fogged the building when we had our first \\'maybe\\' since testing is so hard to get.    all our non field staff are def working from home however! should have stayed a pm!    stay safe everyone! currently a superintendent for a gc, i tell people all the time that i cant build from home. trades and construction workers are keeping america afloat right now my gm emailed me last night and wanted a two week look ahead. i called him and asked him what was going on because i‚Äôve already sent him one. he said they are considering cutting the workforce down to only essential people till this blows over. till then we are running at 100% where i work they implemented a liberal leave policy meaning no penalties besides not getting paid for missing work. today they announced since production is low we can start working seven twelves to make up for production. union? well, when you gotta go.... home remodeler here in the nw. we are all working and hope to keep working so we can keep paying our bills. we are asking clients if they want us there or not. we have work booked out until late fall, but we‚Äôve put one off indefinitely due to the poor health of the owner. everyone here is healthy and so are their families, so we will keep going. it‚Äôs good to have something to do rather than stay home, and well be forced to work on your own house.... as remodelers, we normally use the client‚Äôs bathroom or in some cases a porta potty, but it‚Äôs just for us, so it‚Äôs not nasty. thankfully the porta potty crew is still working and willing to keep the toilets clean. no complaints. everyone wants to continue working. bills to pay. kids are all home though. one guy‚Äôs wife does tattoo make up for a living, she‚Äôs still working, so i guess tattoos must still go on.... it‚Äôs ok....the grunts will keep this planet ticking over. calling all pen pushers...can you push a wheel barrow? i once seen the shit piled over the seat of a shitter because the jobsite didnt want to pay the bill. didnt get cleaned until starbucks complained when we used thier bathrooms. boston shut down all construction for 2 weeks. others should follow as most of it is commercial and indoors. don‚Äôt you union guys have things in place for this? i am fortunate to be a simple handyman. my regulars are still calling and we are all on board with sanitation protocols. if a family member is sick i do not work there. it is a b&g job i‚Äôm just as shocked as you that\\'s pretty much construction everywhere that its not shut down.  we\\'re still working, but a lot of jobs have been shit down. same story in the uk, construction is always the last worry for people few of our sites shut down already i heard friday all construction is shut down is that true? nary a fuck giv‚Äôn, mate service electrician here. honestly i‚Äôm just glad my company gave me the choice to stay home or work if i wanted to. i don‚Äôt expect them to keep paying while i stay home but a lot of people in other fields (bartenders, waiters, etc) didn‚Äôt have a choice. they‚Äôre just out of a job. doing my best to practice good pandemic hygiene, keeping my distance from customers but i‚Äôm still crawling around in someone‚Äôs attic like any other wednesday so... ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è in sweden we get paid if we are sick and they say that you should stay at home if you get any symptoms. so there is no reason to go work if you don\\'t feel 100%, no doctors note is required.  usually you get no money on the first day and then you get 80% of your salary, after 5 days you need a note from the doctor saying that you aren\\'t well but the government changed the law to keep the sickos at home. still only get 80% though i think. under the law the employer must provide a safe work environment. this is impossible during a viral pandemic. anything short of sending everyone home with a clean layoff / furlough = gross negligence.  nyc just ordered a general quarantine - no gatherings of more than 5 people. building a building is not an essential service. take it while you can get it. should be a lot more worried about what‚Äôs happened to the market and the effect that‚Äôll have on jobs for months and months to come. that being said fm clauses should cover pretty much any shut downs right now. good luck my friend be glad we have work when so many others don‚Äôt. take proper precautions. be aware of symptoms. and cut yourself off from your older family, as this will likely save them from exposure. remember we are all essential. regardless of what anyone tells us. sorry to hear man! we‚Äôre all in the same boat. every country, every state, every job site. stay safe! we are in the same boat in america, my job isn\\'t even that important but we keep working and we don\\'t even have masks, gloves or disinfectant. god bless sri lanka. beautiful country. stay safe my friend what project are you building? stay safe brother covid is kill?  no. but think of the stockholders! be safe! keep on keeping on. i feel for you mate. our company ceased all work last friday. take care. it\\'s not a \"mistake\" to call in sick if you\\'re sick, especially right now. hopefully he gets well soon so you can both enjoy the joke. and hopefully he didn\\'t have the virus or it won\\'t be very funny for you having touched all his stuff. damn that\\'s a nice set up for an assistant super, i wish i had that set up. is that a 2019 calendar? glad i‚Äôm not the only one that calls my jobsite the daycare center. lol. how many teenagers work in that office? serious question, how are yalls jobsites handling this thing? my site is large with 50+ people minimum. they as of now are not shutting us down. this may change in the coming days but i\\'m curious about other locations. my favourite part is the water bottle.  what state are you? i\\'m in pa... shut down today- friday this is the bullshit that people not call in sick when calling in when you\\'re sick is entirely the right thing to do, with or without the coronavirus pandemic. this shit needs to stop. i don\\'t know why we in construction feel the need to perpetuate bullshit and take what should be a normal good job and add in all this bullshit that makes it sucks. i know the perps here \"were just joking.\" stop. you fucking jokes are stupid. how about you just stfu and work? safety first sad to see that. not alot of professionalism. ah yes... so good ole fashion office pranks... the world needs more of this right now fair enough that‚Äôs some high quality humour there.  keep it up.  i hope there‚Äôs some kind of surprise in a drawer.  like a tuna sandwich so a large majority of our work comes from rehabbing assisted living facilities. our superintendent is now responsible for taking the temperature of every laborer or subcontractor that walks onto the property each and every day i\\'d be curious what the procedure for taking the temp is.   it\\'s not like any of us has (or at least 99% of us) have any kind of training in infection control when it comes to cleaning a thermometer.  if it were me, i\\'d just be aiming my laser temp gauge in the general direction of the dude\\'s mouth. make sure you fill out your name so you can be blamed if something happens!! didn\\'t they say that 80% of people didn\\'t show any symptoms? how much medical training did they give you? as someone in hr, yikes.  i hope your company got their hr and legal teams together to prepare for when this eventually goes to court.  everything i\\'ve read says that if a pandemic were officially declared, this would be suitable, but until then this is the huge legal risk. where u working at? i‚Äôm really glad we don‚Äôt work for the local hospitals or on their properties anymore. wow, i hadn‚Äôt even thought of that requirement from a client. what about the flu? also does your company supply vacation/sick days or health insurance? we get vacation days we can use as sick days and we have company health insurance. my foreman got tested today, came to work on monday after a skiing trip to austria and didn\\'t feel well the stupid fuck.  atleast two weeks paid leave isn\\'t the worst that could happen ; ). hahahahaha. that sucks. everyone is going to hate you. apprentice friend of mine on a hospital job going through the same thing all last week and for the foreseeable future that‚Äôs pretty hardcore but i understand, the diversity of people on my job is vast but we haven‚Äôt gone to that extreme yet. the owner of a skilled care facility rehab project we are working on is requiring something similar. sounds like a pain to manage from a field side. i also work for a gc that does a lot of senior living/hospital work. there are rumors that this is going to be happening for us soon as well. where are you located if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? i tried to call out of work two weeks ago because of flu-like symptoms.  my boss was like ‚Äúawh damn dude ‚Äî i mean, i‚Äôve been sick too man and *im* still here, sooooo i mean like your not going to be in trouble but we‚Äôre pouring concrete today man we need the help‚Äù. so i went in and reluctantly ran the chute for 25 fuckin yards.    i have never felt so fucking sick and tired than when i got home after that shit.    tldr:  my company doesn‚Äôt give a god damn if u have coronavirus u better be there or u can go work at wendy‚Äôs. no doubt my project gets shut down soon. the school told all the kids to go home this weekend for the rest of the semester.  where is this happening? please. too bad by the time you\\'re noticing symptoms you\\'ve already spread the disease sheesh... i definitely sympathize with the guy who has to now manage this additional paperwork with all the other stuff. laborers and journeyman can\\'t complain to much as it\\'s only 5 minutes out of they day, which safety meetings take as long if not longer. wtf. world going insane they are starting to screen people for the hospital i work in as a contract plumber.. i feel sorry for you, so assuming one of these guys are sick, we\\'ll have to assume you are too! godspeed my friend oh wow, you got a medical degree and work in construction?!  cause i mean ...only doctors can decide who is healthy enough to go to work...right? make sure you give them all a proper hand shake too first step of creating an official looking company form: use microsoft word default font. they will find ways to label all construction as \"essential\" because construction = good economy. don\\'t expect the higher ups to take care of us. we have to take care of each other on the job site and most importantly look after yourself. forgot to mention we have about 50 people on site i‚Äôm sitting here right now thinking how pointless it is as a construction worker to try to keep the virus off my hands when working.   i touch so many different surfaces and i am in areas where so many people have been i feel like i would go through a gallon a day.   at this point i have sadly resolved myself to the fact that i will get it while working. our site shut down for quarantine. normally for other people it‚Äôs 14 days. for our site it was three. but don‚Äôt worry they brought in 4 extra wash stations. take that corona. all the office people are home though. wouldn‚Äôt want them to have to slum it like us blue collars we call those pink eye dispensers :-/ we started building our own with small hot water heaters and a basin. we‚Äôve set up about 30 throughout the bay area. not a hard solution and all the materials are readily available at hd. i came here to say thank you for all the hard work that you guys do.  please stay safe and healthy. just ordered 2 of those and 2 hand sanitizer stations for my project with no more than 3 small crews working at a time. hopefully we are good my gc took the bag of sanitizer rrom our biffy for his personal use. cannot wait for our governor to declare a stay at home. [removed] if anything,.dont touch your face just piss on your hands, the ammonia in urine is a better sanitizer anyway. i\\'m in charge of a site with 20+- crew non union. i spray the restrooms and commonly touched surfaces 3 times daily with a 10% sodium hypochlorite solution daily. i check all personnel daily for fevers. i have also personally invested in face shields for the labors who jump in the trenches with close contact. this is utter bullshit that others are not taking these precautions. we are blessed to work and we have to protect our subs, vendors, and our employees. figuring this virus lives a very long time on plastic.   this is a horrible device that should be taken away. building a data center for hospital, they‚Äôre making us wear masks and stay at least 6ft apart, how tf are two guys supposed to do that on a skyjack lmao, and i‚Äôd wear a damn mask if i could find them, sold out everywhere. hell me and my buddy even had to get temp checked this morning, we weren‚Äôt even working in the main building, this shits so dumb we dont even have a handwashing station and i\\'m in nys. fuck the gc and the company which owns the building. i\\'m sure they could get one, they are too fucking lazy. ü§¨ most likely there are already 5 million people infected in the us since january. where‚Äôs your job? i‚Äôll take it. we had to rig a water cooler to operate by pedal. actually works fairly proficiently. i did add an additional toilet. we aren‚Äôt running many guys but i wanted to make sure we never ran out of sanitizer, and the companies won‚Äôt sell you them separate right now. i always put a sliver of a chlorine tablet in ours ;) i was just at an maintenance outage for a paper mill with thousands of workers and the hand washing station i went to ran out of hand sanitizer or soap so they put out body wash to use instead gc here. we will be getting hand washing stations at our site soon due to people stealing hand sanitizer in the porta johns. also our porta johns servicing company is no longer able to receive any more hand sanitizer from their distributer..   any suggestions for good hand washing stations?? i had all my sites plumb in a laundry sink and ordered motion faucets the governments can be stupid cause they have no clue that your average jobsite are filthy and unsanitary. but what do they know there heads up each other\\'s asses in the office. am i missing something?  i mean... for 50 guys you should have more than one probably... but if it\\'s kept stocked with soap and towels and there\\'s a trashcan nearby... what\\'s the problem? you guys need to give up on this mandatory and possibly paid two weeks off shit.  it‚Äôs never going to happen.  i mean fuck, jefe wants us back by easter.  now the management is just going to want us to work on easter too.  just give up on the whole ‚Äúhaving time off to enjoy your life‚Äù thing lmao. a lot of detroit is doing that right now fastest way to do that:   a can of spray paint. tag a graphic phallus inside a pothole. the city will cover that shit up in no time. dc and baltimore area never stops paving shit, i\\'m trying. got to get dot to release more projects and relax on lane restrictions. las vegas is doing that. the casinos are remodeling as well caltrans is trying to excelerate roadwork. it  is good idea, but if the whole point of shutdowns is to isolate people and prevent spread, it kind of defeats the purpose doesn‚Äôt it? suppliers would have to operate, shipping, and field workers would be out and about interacting with each other. i work in electrical and would like to continue working, but it does bother me that office workers in my industry are quarantining themselves but want us to continue working. it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre more immune from this than everyone else... some idiot will still drive through the wet concrete they need to do this in my city  there supposed to start a road expansion while there is low traffic but they haven‚Äôt yet i‚Äôve noticed more road work by the city this week dc seems to be doing this [that\\'s what we are trying to do here in minnesota.](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/03/20/officials-coronavirus-shouldnt-upend-minnesota-road-construction) genius this whole pandemic really just confirms what alot of people already know about the people that sign their checks, i think. speaking from my perspective, non-union skilled laborer/ assistant superintendent for a gc doing everything i can to get the experience to move into a superintendent position and run jobs on my own. the owner of my company \"cares about everything going on\" but she\\'s breathing down my neck to meet an impossible deadline. and her reasoning? \"it will make us look good\". i hate it, i absolutely want to tell all the subs on the job that they deserve better, and to refuse to work in the conditions our company is forcing them in. but i know it\\'s not going to change anything,  they have kids at home they have to feed. and if they take my advice then someone who doesn\\'t care will just take their place and they would be stuck jobless to just to prevent something that might happen to them.   i know i\\'m not going to be with this company forever but i really feel like now wouldn\\'t be a good time to start a job search. so like others i feel like i\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard place. props to this guy, almost every site i\\'ve worked on has been seriously lacking in hygiene stations and general cleanliness. this guy is right.  construction companies want essential work to continue so they can keep the checks coming.  for anyone looking to send something to their higher ups, feel free to copy and paste:     most employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  the administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  stopping work as a safety decision due to covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, it is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the covid-19 virus around...   since a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  this would include at a minimum:   1. provide necessary ppe (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment) 2. provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces  3. look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.) 4. crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other. 5. consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. 6. allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (this may require more time)  i assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  there are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  these scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.  the first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  we don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.    to conclude, as a last approach, i will stop work if i don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  while a lot of things are uncertain, i find that it is **part** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.    this is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. all the hispanic workers are like, \"que?\" i can really resonate with this dude. my situation is a bit different where i work for a small residential gc and we\\'re doing remodels and new construction on people\\'s homes. my state just released an order yesterday that says as of midnight tomorrow, we are to stay at home unless of course we are considered essential, which it is outlined that construction trades are.  i don\\'t work with large groups of people but i find myself running to stores a lot for work equipment and supplies, i deliver them to houses where we have trades working and touching everything, and i\\'d be lying if i said i didn\\'t feel a little uncomfortable doing so in times like this where in this area we are watching the number of covid cases creep up.   i just had my first child at the end of january. she is two months old today. her mom hasn\\'t gone back to work and most likely will not since it doesn\\'t make sense for her to keep working service jobs to pay for daycare, and with restaurants being closed for weeks now she wouldn\\'t be working anyway. i\\'m the sole provider for the home life i\\'ve built and i don\\'t want to go to work for fear that i\\'m going to bring this shit home to my family. we are healthy so far but anxious beyond belief. i can\\'t help but google what goes on every day and listen to public radio to hear about the latest developments. while to some extent we are essential that we need to wrap up people\\'s homes for them to prevent fucking up their closing dates or to board up their homes to be safe from the elements, it\\'s hard to stay motivated when i\\'m as worried as i am.  i have the most mixed feelings about what is to come. great that i have a job and still working, i\\'m luckier than most until i wonder if i really am or not when i\\'d rather be safe at home. i don\\'t want to worry anymore if i\\'m going to get my wife and baby sick by trying to provide for them. as someone that runs multi million dollar projects as a gc, this virus has been a detriment to employee morale. we‚Äôve gone to provide as much social distancing measures as possible, proper ppe, and sanitizer stations everywhere. despite the precautions, workers continue to be very worried.   i‚Äôm worried too and i don‚Äôt know what else i can do. when you know just what your company knows, it feels awful knowing if one of your guys gets it, it could put the entire crew at risk. if you get sick at work, you\\'re eligible for workers comp. when employers, and more importantly, workers, realize this then jobs will get shut down. most everyone on my crew isn\\'t worried about getting severely ill from the coronavirus, they\\'re worried about taking it home and getting their wives, children, or parents severely ill is this guys company doing their part? it‚Äôs real easy to point the finger at the gc but the gc also doesn‚Äôt have to provide him his ppe either. there‚Äôs a line of company responsibility by his employer as well.   granted some gc are in fact just shy of worthless with respect to the general health and welfare of the workers, but the context here is unclear.   if only guys like this were as passionate about pulling a broom behind them as they go. i love how he steps right on tripping hazard he probably left behind on his way down from his soapbox. i set aside a little bit of that anger for the fucking communist party of china who also owns reddit.     those fuckers are ground zero almost every single flu.  i think there should be consequences.  we\\'ve all been making them rich for so long now. literally had the same meeting yesterday. all workers have the right to a safe and healthy workplace and also have the right to refuse unsafe work. all precautions should be in place and no one is expected to put themselves at risk.  however, this guy is another union blowhard who is only interested in stirring up shit to get more memberships. not productive. oh look canadians giving up. i\\'d assume they are french canadians [deleted] well done. health is above money. a new meaning for dead line being on a basket lift is about as good social distancing as you can get. so the carps and the painters huh? bac is gonna be up on the wall till jesus calls it himself. mason love baby, stay safe. thought this was r/jokes for a minute. [deleted] [deleted] can\\'t read. paywall no worries, it‚Äôll be a cluster the minute you‚Äôre back on the job. enjoy it while it lasts .... cause we all know that trailer will be back to chaos as soon as work refires. i highly recommend those storage totes in the back: https://www.walmart.com/ip/durabilt-27-gal-plastic-storage-tote-gray-teal-set-of-4/160965210 i love the harbor freight lights ‚Äúya cant wait to get in there and fuck it all up for ya‚Äù -every employee ever now how long sill it last?! :) wow looks nice!!! have you thought about mounting your stand on the ceiling or wall instead of the floor?  and then perhaps a bench on the left to double stack your miter, tanks, tubs ect? i‚Äôve done that and it‚Äôll stay clean for about half a job *one project later* life goals. somebody put a lot of thought into this can confirm the water is mixed with bleach. this should have been a thing on all jobsites betore coronavirus props to whomever did this.  may not be the prettiest of things, but they are working on keeping the guys safe(r).  we can\\'t even find a biffy that still has sanitizer in it i like this, virus or not. hi there, entry level project engineer for a gc here in the states and there are no hand washing stations left to rent in our area. going to duplicate this set up this weekend for our guys. even if it comes out of my $1200 stimulus check the gov is dishing out for people. thanks for posting, this really means more than you know. all that work then you put the soap in a container you have to touch lol. how‚Äôs that on/off work? better put in spanish too meanwhile, no paper in the shitter.. i like it, but you should only be hand washing in potable water. not osha compliant unless it‚Äôs in spanish too!!   (buzzer) nice message, but construction workers are still working right now, and we use these same respirators. the shortage is affecting us too. if anyone in the trades has these masks they are using using them for themselves, since back order is over 2 months for this stuff.  edit: our supplier just informed us to not expect anymore masks or filters for the rest of the year. we have a homeless family ready to move into the place we\\'re working on the minute we\\'re done and we\\'re working without protection.  we need to protect health care workers. i used to be a nurse, i agree.  but i\\'m really sick of people asking me to give up something that i don\\'t have, assuming that i don\\'t need it. and isn\\'t housing for a homeless family just as important to stop the spread of the virus? my state health department says it\\'s critical. so i go to work without ppe because doctors and nurses are heroes but blue collar workers just don\\'t matter, even when we\\'re contributing to the solutions.  if i actually find some masks, i\\'m sure as fuck going to use them. guys on our job site (concrete) can‚Äôt even find masks anywhere. what pisses me off is seeing random people walking around the streets with them on. these are people simply going about their daily routine, not healthcare workers or construction workers.  i hope the people in public wearing masks feel safe in their minds while the guys building the medical facilities are getting silicosis. or the healthcare staff are getting sick from treating corona patients. fuck off, i was up in this crusty ass attic for 7 hours the other day and we had no masks cause of this bullshit i work as a film carpenter. we got shut down a few weeks ago and our union has been organizing and donating masks and other things (gloves, literally hospital gear from hospital shows like hand sanitizer) but i do worry that when we go back to work we wont have anything. i get priorities, but  sure hope i have a spare set of cartridges for my mask somewhere in my kit.... another thing to note about these is that you can very easily halve your filter usage by sealing off one cartridge inlet and just using one cardtridge or filter at a time. it‚Äôs not the best way to use it but if you are using the filters as one offs it‚Äôs an option to prolong how many you have i know a couple construction companies that aren‚Äôt donating their ppe since they‚Äôre still working and don‚Äôt want to catch an osha violation i was lucky enough to get a p95 3m respirator by pure chance at home depot like 3 days ago. they had like 2 left because someone returned them (wtf?). sealed in a bag so brand new, never opened. deleted lawn care and landscaping business owner here, we need the masks in our work too and having trouble finding them... op, nothing wrong with your post.  but it makes me reflect on how fucked this presidents preparation for and response to this pandemic is.   people serving others, people are dying, and people are sacrificing and he\\'s busy inserting personal tax dodges into the relief bill ..... mf. [deleted] i have a few(2), and i\\'m not working, . however, i can totally see bringing them in and some hospital authority throwing them out because \" they aren\\'t new\"  or \" not the right specs. do you think that would happen? i\\'m really really poor and the idea of me giving away something very valuable to me just to have it thrown away, makes me worry. i have at least 20 from when i did some home remodeling.   called a couple hospitals in dc and they said they didn\\'t want them as they couldn\\'t verify they were unused/clean.   guess there staying in my basement. i should mention that as a construction worker, in canada at least, i have the right to refuse unsafe work. that can mean a lot of things but in this case, if you are not being provided the proper ppe to do a job safely you have the right to refuse to do it with no fear of penalty. your employer cannot fire you if you say to them you are unwilling to insulate an attic without a proper respirator. end of discussion. if the health care workers require the respirator more than the engine of a country then so be it. shut down!!! both are important but they are very different. for context: a respirator and a mask are two different things, what is pictured and being talked about is a mask, a wearable passive air cleansing device. what is being talked about that hospitals need to save lives are respirators, machines that actively push and pull air and basically breathe for someone that‚Äôs lungs are too weak. badass cranes i can see that tower from the tower i\\'m working.   if a tower like that one needs to be demolished how do they do it? floor by floor? who‚Äôs the gc and major subs?  any insider stories from the project?  major problems / unique design etc i wonder, is it safer to have the booms straight up during offtime? i could see it preventing some strain in certain places, but also creating it in others.. anybody have any info regarding such? that\\'s some glorious \\'essential\\' work.. what‚Äôs up toronto! i drive by this building all the time on the way to my site. ahhhh this is 81 bay street , i was there for the last 10 months , it was a shit show walking up all those stairs when the hoists were down ; people still working at this  job site during corona ? their concern is legitimate. if anyone thinks safety or cleanliness regulations, on an active job site, is going to prevent people or their families from getting covid, you are absolutely kidding yourself. ‚Äúthe union says the trump administration\\'s order blocking osha from issuing regulations to protect workers from covid-19‚Äù  why am i not surprised. i don‚Äôt care if your union or not. 90% of construction you can‚Äôt social distant for. try installing a window with one person or a 250# door. i‚Äôve been doing carpentry for 20+ years and have done a lot of stuff alone. theirs some you just need more people for. i also hear about the other side because my wife is a nurse. trust me you don‚Äôt want covid-19 they\\'re walking off our job at somerville hs on friday. i\\'m in local 4, ibew and laborers are apparently out so we\\'re out as well. i‚Äôm a small remodeling company and there is no way we can be six feet apart working in a bathroom or even some kitchens we do.  two of my guys left the state when this all started and the other two are too scared to come to work.  so it‚Äôs just me and my husband finishing up three job sites in various stages.  only one of the houses is actually occupied and i insisted the home owners wear masks while we are there. i wish my state would shut us down, i hate going to the hardware store. good start we are 200 000 construction worker not working in quebec.. everyone needs to wear some sort of mask 100% of the time when in public, folks. curious if we could go back to work with 100% respirator usage. go figure, a union ordering its members to not work. how innovative tell me about it brother. i work for the railroad. carpenter for a very reputable national company. the president came out to the job the other day and the summary of his speech was ‚Äú the office workers are all home, but we need you in the field because we can‚Äôt make money if you don‚Äôt show up so it‚Äôs business as usual!‚Äù man does anyone here honestly know anyone that has been confirmed positive for coronavirus?  and i don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúoh my cousins brothers roommates sister in law thinks she has it so idk man i‚Äôm not going to work‚Äù. i mean you tell me how i\\'m supposed to make sales calls to superintendents from home? you think everyone just has a phone and an internet connection these days? no, the only way to build relationships is to spread cv19 from jobsite to jobsite. http://chng.it/bg9yvgrvcv except your not going to die. if your of regular working age then it‚Äôs about equally deadly to the flu..... my wife is trying to get me to stop working right now.  i\\'m in western ma. but all my subcontractors are showing up, i\\'m showing up, the client wants us to show up. we are just dirty construction workers.... no one cares if we get sick and die....get back to work can anybody‚Äôs workforce‚Äôs afford to sit on their asses for 2 weeks is a better question.  i know a lot of our guys live paycheck to paycheck. i am a small business, i can cover this up to a certain point but after that it is going to have to be back to work.  i hope they come up with some sort of subsidy for people who can‚Äôt get paid  during this period going hard in sf. working 6-12‚Äôs. can‚Äôt build elevators from home haha. no union meetings and i think they cancelled our apprenticeship classes for a while.   wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if things start slowing down though. i work for one of the big 5 elevator companies so  could see them being more careful than the smaller shops. in the end i suppose it‚Äôs up to the gc.  stay safe and wash your hands brothers and sisters. in seattle, we are still going.  traffic is great. lol if we stop doing our trade then the builder will just bring in someone else. our client asked for any potential materials that could be delayed and mitigation efforts if we have to shut down for two weeks. my project is nearly done so luckily i have no concerns about materials not showing up but there is plenty of labor to do through august. being that this is a school project...kind of forced to get it done in time for the start of the school year. i don‚Äôt know if this has been mentioned anywhere, but are our employers required to pay us if the country as a whole goes into a quarantine?  slightly worried about that. we do interior finish out work in high rises, we\\'re discussing strategies with building management if there\\'s a significant risk inside the building. i work in the av industry; we have had lots of clients cancel appointments. i‚Äôve only worked two days this week and one day last week. new baby comes this weekend and i‚Äôm screwed financially atm right now i\\'m working a project in the international terminal of a major airport and no one as of yet has even hinted at shutting the project down.  in fact they are on our ass daily about how long it\\'s taking... sorry dude, you can only go so fast when you work hours for welding and making noise are from 10pm to 430am. i\\'m an estimator and have underlying health issues and was just told today to work from home through march. these are weird times. we had our monthly safety meeting this morning but also talked about cv. my job depends on the metal market, so far the stock market is holding okay on metal prices. obviously, we‚Äôre not going to be shipping anything internationally and there‚Äôs not a huge market for it nationally right now. i rarely come in contact with people since i‚Äôm an equipment operator. they said we‚Äôll continue to work and see what happens but anyways i could care less about myself since i‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs and relatively healthy. what i‚Äôm worried about though, are my parents who are in their mid 60‚Äôs which they‚Äôre also healthy but dad works in a major hospital and mom works with children and my girlfriend and her family live overseas very close to asia. here‚Äôs to hoping everything will pass very soon. still out here in mi doing siding. on lake st clair today i\\'m in the process of billing everything we have open right now in the event of inevitable shut downs. it\\'s extremely concerning in the construction industry, especially when you consider the fact that the median age of a construction worker is older than many other industries. i run a water jet for a glass fabrication factory that mainly provides things like shower doors and enclosures for new construction. i received my orders via email. i usually get about 20 to 40 a day. in the last two days i\\'ve had one and that was yesterday morning. absolutely nothing today. still going strong in nc. was just having this conversation and i‚Äôm honestly not sure what is going to happen. i can do probably 60% of my job from home the rest being field supervision. on a very high profile job where time and public eye are the biggest factors, i can‚Äôt imagine anyone would just go ghost on the job. there could be a specific outbreak throughout the entire construction industry and our bosses would still threaten to fire us if we took a day off because ‚Äúshit man i come in when im sick, so idk what your problem is man if u don‚Äôt want to be here go work at wendy‚Äôs‚Äù. i work for new englands largest hvac and plumbing wholesaler and as of this morning we have cancelled all customer/ employee trainings as well as counter day gatherings i‚Äôm a superintendent for a large scale renovation of a pathology lab in a major state university hospital that just announced their first cases of covid-19. things have been pretty crazy the last few days, really ramping up. however, we are not shutting down yet, but i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs on the table for next week. there‚Äôs word they might be utilizing the exhaust fans we were in the process of demo‚Äôing to help set up temporary isolation containment units for the expected influx of patients. so that‚Äôs interesting. i\\'m in pa but i already work from home, i\\'m just waiting for the email that says to stay home from all job sites, we are allowed to take up to 10 days off if we live in an area that is a quarantine area, but i do not we have two projects in senior care facilities all work has been suspended. one we only had a few rooms left and punchlist to complete now who knows how long until we will be able to finish i run a small home remodeling business and all my interior jobs are being pushed back. luckily i have a few exterior jobs in the meantime.  i will also be ordering all my materials for delivery as soon as i can. we‚Äôre building a commons building for the university of denver. the university is going to online classes for a while, but we have no plans of shutting down. we\\'ve had pm\\'s screening workers for covid-19 before they enter sites. they were joking about it only a couple days ago, but now they\\'ve really changed their tune.  &#x200b;  edit: and by screen, i mean ask if they\\'ve traveled to any of the high risk areas, or if they are showing symptoms. there are no tests. working in ne on a hospital, i\\'ve been home for a few days now. the site is still going strong, but i showed up with a little cough and they told me to take the rest of the week off. wouldn\\'t be surprised if we get shut down entirely though in the next week. as of right now no way.  doing a water bureau job and it‚Äôs kind of a unspoken thing lingering but no one wants stop working.  i mean i‚Äôm fine with it if they deferred all my bills but until then we‚Äôll be on site everyday.  kind of have to i do so love this industry- usually it‚Äôs the brickies that are fucking whiners - this now seems to have spread.  every company and owner i have worked for in ne (healthcare & higher ed) have valued and thanked the trades for doing what they do.  so perhaps you need to look for a new line of work in this industry.  your issue is not with the client or owner - it‚Äôs with your chicken shit leadership at your own company - they are grinding you all to a knub and blaming the owner.    owners will do what they are allowed to do - if they want a 10 month job done in 8 months and your leadership signs a contract to that effect who‚Äôs responsible?  they will take jobs that are based in fantasyland by some owner who needs to be educated or some architect who doesn‚Äôt pay attention the to world around them  the gc/cm brings a skill set to the process and that needs to be sought out, respected and valued by all involved.  but instead companies continue to shoot themselves in the foot and screw clients over as far as meeting the clients expectations.  this industry screws itself over and then cry‚Äôs poor as the owners of the company‚Äôs drive their luxury cars to their luxury homes.  it‚Äôs the only industry i know that owners have to hire a 3rd party firm (opm‚Äôs) in order to deal with the bullshit the gc/cm or the a&e firm is tossing against the wall.  not even used car salesman are treated with that kind of disdain.  and it‚Äôs all the fault of the construction industry.  your company - if it had balls would say ‚Äúwe value our employees safety and we are shutting down the job until such time as this force majeure (that should be in your contract with the owner) passes.‚Äù  but they don‚Äôt - why is that? cash flow?   you betcha - luxury cars and houses don‚Äôt pay for themselves- your sore back pays for it.   as my favorite jamaican labor used to say ‚Äúain‚Äôt nothing to but to do it.‚Äù  so get back to work! i get this question from guys all the time right now. they say it‚Äôs not safe and we shouldn‚Äôt be working. then i ask would you be willing to stay home without pay? then we work.   ain‚Äôt no way for a company to cover everyone‚Äôs payroll and have everyone shut down not working. what state are you in? my job are still up and running but with a lot of health precautions. my city is still relatively unaffected with only 2 reported cases with a population of 250,000 thankfully my project is in the punch out stage, so i don\\'t have to interact with many people. just a handful of guys i point to things at for them to fix. nope i‚Äôm working through with my company in the uk none in the construction industry are staying at home and if theres one industry that should its ours i‚Äôm still working, i don‚Äôt plan on stopping because i need the money, so hopefully sites don‚Äôt get shut down california here, working on the freeway. headquarters in san francisco. caltrans don‚Äôt care about cv, they want us to keep working..... i‚Äôm currently on a hotel project. the buildings occupancy has really died down since the start of all this. a lot of big conferences/shows here have been canceled and rooms are empty. the gc announced in the meeting if it keeps going the way things are there is a high probability that the project gets shut down. i know our big yearly union meetings canceled but the job sites are still active my job hasn‚Äôt stopped yet but i work for myself. if there comes a time when people aren‚Äôt leaving their homes at all then i will be forced to stay home too. waiting for the job site to open rn we have a job at a hospital here in n.c. and it has been postponed until further notice. working in central london, public transport is noticeable quiet. its fantastic!!! rumors are someone was showing symptoms at mile long bridge in willow springs near chicago. that project may be delayed. i work for a large gc on a site with 700+ people...talks about shutdowns have been ongoing, we have to have an official shutdown plan prepared by the end of day tomorrow.  we have hired second shift cleaners to sanitize all handrails/doorknobs etc.  everything is escalating very quickly.  all it would take is 1 person presumed positive to shut the whole thing down.  thats what we are preparing for, and what i personally am expecting. i‚Äôve got no updates on my projects shutting down, but i work in the office and we received an email today saying we‚Äôre testing out working from home tomorrow and monday. if i had to bet we‚Äôre going to start shutting down job sites in the next month or so desk job guy here. i still have to come into work but i‚Äôm not allowed site visits at this time lol that‚Äôs what we are waiting for now. we‚Äôve already had 2 shit weeks with rain and jobs pushing, and if one of the big gc‚Äôs we work for decides to shut down for 2 weeks, we‚Äôll have almost 0 revenue in march. interesting times. boss man keeps paying me and i‚Äôll show up. i work in nyc, i\\'m more worried about mass transit shutting down than my site lol i am afraid this will happen to me in a couple of weeks , the company i work for will only last like a month at most without production we are gcs for the houston based apartment industry. it\\'s a bit slow but there is work to be done. earlier this week we painted 30 + units . for different buildings obviously we have a job site standdown this friday to \\'talk about\\' the virus, symptoms and how to treat them. yah this sounds like a great idea, lets stuff 150 tradesmen on a single floor after coffee break. ffs i‚Äôm from croatia. most of materials are coming from italy, which is blocked now, so we are starting to slow down.  i have team of 6 workers plus me, and we live in an apartment literally 100 meters from construction site. we will keep working till we have materials. i know everybody thinks about corona now, but if it continues for a few more weeks it will trigfer recession and then we are in shithole, we will beg for work then, and stupid investors will just hold on to money. some of our work in washington at a major employer is shut down i\\'m a pipefitter in ut and i\\'m all outta work.. just enough savings to last maybe a month not because of the coronavirus, but i just got diagnosed with the flu this morning. sent home for a mandatory four day period. i pleaded with my boss to let me stay and work but he refused to let me. it\\'s apparently a new policy that started because of the coronavirus. i sit in my tower crane far away from everyone because  nobody gives a s*** about dirty construction workers we\\'re shut down in washington state, most of us 1-3 man crews building houses wish they were working...  especially small business owners i\\'m thankful to not only be working, but even getting overtime to go with it. that being said, the project were working on is an expansion/remodel on a hospital so i do feel a slight bit essential. i found an old half squashed n95 mask in my trunk i‚Äôve been wearing for a week now as someone who has never worked construction, i would not know that construction workers are still working if i didn\\'t get that information from you folks. i admit that i just joined this sub to see my childhood toys come to life, but you are real people being purposefully erased from the public eye and that\\'s fucked up. most essential workers are to keep individuals alive.  construction workers are to keep the economy alive.   shutting down construction also hurts the entire supply chain.  logging, mines, manufacturers, refractories, developers, contractors, gcs, owners, suppliers, etc.  these aren‚Äôt minimum wage industries, good paying jobs in high dollar industries that pay a lot in taxes. i spray sunblock when working in the sun in ny the governor shut down non-essential construction. so hospitals and infrastructure projects are still going. you just have to \"try\" and maintain social distancing. our job, affordable housing in sf is doing a good job constantly sanitizing all floors and stairwells throughout the day (they hired additional labor just for this), stairwells are whither up or down travel, two to the man lift.   as a company we are sanitizing tools, working separate and social distancing at break. i‚Äôm an elevator constructor so we‚Äôre pretty separated from the rest of the other trades for the most part. our site just released a plan. washing stations on floors, hand sanitizers at elevators, distancing. real nice to do it now in michigan it\\'s not, we\\'ve been out of work for a couple weeks now.  i got on unemployment, but just recently picked up a temp job instead to keep me busy, but i\\'m a strange duck and i\\'m in a fairly safe area--low population very few cases etc. i agree wholeheartedly, what we are building is not essential, we are being exposed to a \"known hazard\" unnecessarily and unlike some of the bigger jobs there is nothing being done to mitigate that hazard on my job. i have suggested that we set up some wash basins where a guy could properly wash his hands, i have suggested that we pour some bleach in our hudson sprayers and disinfect the site and commonly used tools and lifts and i have suggested that we start running split shifts to help guys socially distance but it only led to me getting an earful from the superintendent.   this is a crock, safety is a joke. wow they give you masks on your site? must be nice.... michigan construction got shutdown unless the job deemed essential because you guys don\\'t make unicorn lattes for their writers. i work commercial construction in canada-mostly grocery stores so i get we are somewhat essential. we are the gc so there‚Äôs been some challenges. but we got pumped water hand wash stations, upped porta potty cleaning, wipe down our tools, disinfect common areas (doors, handrails, etc), instructed our trades to do so as well, ensure social distancing, limiting site to 50 workers, have 2x weekly covid briefings.  i am struggling to find cleaning products and ppe that is necessary for my guys to do their jobs. i have been able to provide nitrile gloves, hand sani, and 1/2 mask respirators.  i will say that the cooperation and camaraderie that we have built up on our site has helped a lot though! with the fact that all we can do is work and go home and stay home, it‚Äôs nice to have a great team. i said that a second hawai‚Äôi home for a non-resident wasn‚Äôt essential in my opinion and quarantined myself. construction trade associations and lobbyists have a lot of pull right now in many states and they want to keep the workforce in place. it took us a decade to catch up to pre 2009 recession workforce numbers and they refuse to let us our workforce dwindle again if they can prevent it. still building condos in southern california.  we apparently have a housing crisis here and have been told that\\'s the reason. not sure we are building affordable housing though üòÇ we are essential as we are keeping the economy going by fixing a housing shortage. that is what i found out why i can keep my business going right now. i think that might change as soon as this week. we have people dropping out of their contract. a larger electricial company told me three of their 20 neighborhoods they are wiring have shut down. so prepare yourselves if you living in a high effective area like i do. they are saying end of june before they would consider even opening our state. go to home depot and see all the people black friday shopping and you would think everything is fine. not sure why so many people can\\'t grasp the severity of the situation, just stay home and we can get through this a lot quicker. in california we‚Äôre still building everything. i wonder if they just don‚Äôt want more people unemployed. imagine how much bigger of a shit the economy would be taking if another 7.5mil people weren‚Äôt working. it doesn‚Äôt make it right, it‚Äôs just something i‚Äôve been thinking. at least you‚Äôre getting masks. we get nothing unless we provide it ourselves. our gc brought in 1 ‚Äúhand washing station‚Äù for 60 guys funny thing is, it‚Äôs not hooked up to anything because there‚Äôs no water to the project yet! we razed hell here in ontario messaging our premier and unions demanding shut down of non-essential sites. got the message through and most workers last day was the 3rd. only sites open now are hospitals and the likes. /r/aboringdystopia here in nyc i\\'m home collecting $1100 a week unemployment because 90% of construction has been deemed non essential i can think of multiple hazards on any given job site that are far more likely to kill you than covid-19. and we should be grateful to still be working. a lot of people i‚Äôve heard complaining are people who just want time off work, i have a coworker who even admitted this. however, time off doesn‚Äôt pay the bills in construction.  you don‚Äôt hear talks about us because we are the people everyone hates, but everyone needs. we make noise, inconvenience people, shut down roads, but when shit goes wrong, or shit needs built, there we are. also ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always entail huge projects with 100+ workers. it encompasses projects of all types, and emergency repairs of all types (such as infrastructure, plumbing, electric, and so on). not in us, we have been locked down for 4 weeks and looking forward to getting back out there. but listening to posts like this make me thankful for our governments swift action. (never thought i would say that) thankful to be working civil in colorado. spend more time in the home office, enough time on site with a mask. keep 10 feet, don\\'t share equipment - spray it with virucide several times a day.  we\\'re getting more done due to less traffic. luckily i only have one other person at home, and i think we\\'ve both already recovered from covid. we are fixing all the people\\'s broken sinks toilets water heaters garage door openers....everything that can break in your house...during quarentine...we fix it    stop buying fucking diy projects shot at home depot s we can do our own job and stay home    building new homes isn\\'t essential...parts of our jobs are..most arnt....we can\\'t pay fast food workers enough to live yet all of sudden people who prepare shitty fast food and scan barcodes at grocery stores are saints and deserve 90k a year. üôè the people that are working..have to work.  it isn\\'t like any essential business had to shut down.. they got to stay open..you can\\'t say no to your job or thell fire you...i\\'m sure almost everyone wants o be at home ..theyres random businesses that have parts that matter and parts that don\\'t.. sure as fuck don\\'t need icecream and dildos. the only thing standing between me and certain coronavirus is a thin piece of dry-fit cloth these days. i work residential. the site supervisors are supposed to be scheduling properly to keep trades apart, but some trades don\\'t listen. i show up early, and lock all the doors in the house so i\\'m alone. if someone manages to get in, i yell at them until they leave, then rat them out to the super. this week i got two people kicked off the site for the day. still remodeling bathrooms and kitchens in idaho (one of the last 4 states to get a confirmed case and among the first 17 to shut down, plus it‚Äôs somewhat rural so it hasn‚Äôt hit us as hard). my boss is taking it seriously after brushing it off at first, my coworker not so much (insists on not wearing a mask and getting in my bubble to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me when i don‚Äôt need help). i wear a mask when i have to get close to people (especially him), otherwise i just try to keep a distance and not schedule our subs on the same day. at least my boss realizes we need to step it up and advertise our compliance with cdc guidelines to get new jobs. don\\'t be a bitch. business as usual for the construction boys!   i\\'m so glad to have a job at the moment! i\\'m on a govt site right now and they\\'ve locked the door to the main facility with just a skeleton crew in operation for the next 2 weeks, they\\'re literally bringing in supplies and leaving them in an elevator for the crew to pick up separately. the city has shut down all of their offices and have their employees working from home. meanwhile we\\'re onsite, staying in hotels, having to eat fast food from the drive through because all the super markets are sold out of almost everything and they send all of us letters saying we are essential and if we choose to leave the project it is voluntarily, but we\\'re still on the hook to being completed on schedule. like wtf? where is the logic in that? i spoke with my boss today and expressed my concerns, and he said if we feel it\\'s getting too unsafe we should take off, so i think this will be our last week here for the foreseeable future. it\\'s just infuriating that the gov\\'t will turn a blind eye towards contractors doing their work for them in this situation. useless 3 minute \"stretch and flex\" every morning? check.  harness up any time i am over 4 feet on a ladder? check. kevlar god damned sleeves any time i am working above ceiling grid? check. stay home during global pandemic? get fucked, buddy. sucks to be a construction worker right now.  i\\'m fairly lucky that i personally do small installations where i\\'m usually with just 1 or 2 other guys and we don\\'t need much contact from anyone else.     a lot of construction workers live paycheck to paycheck, and smaller construction companies are also essentially paycheck to paycheck, they can\\'t afford to shut down for even just a week or 2.     hopefully whatever the government passes eases the burden on this industry, but right now construction sites are ripe for spreading the virus. take a lay off or furlough. that‚Äôs what our company and union are offering if you don‚Äôt want to work. my job site is crazy clean and following guidelines. i feel ya though man. 10% of my jobsite has tested positive for coronavirus this week. got me a doctor\\'s note that very politely says are you fucking nuts and i\\'m staying home  i know the company\\'s gotta keep the lights on, but i\\'m not cool with a 20% chance of being hospitalized for $35/hour yeah man. i‚Äôve been all over twitter making a stink. i‚Äôve already been interviewed by three journalists. new york is scary as shit right now and i‚Äôm building luxury condos that billionaires will rent to millionaires. it‚Äôs amazing how the gcs here seem to be doing nothing and my foreman acts like your some pussy because all of a sudden your production drops because you are not ok with not washing your hands after going the bathroom now.   fucking stay safe. all of yous. as a equipment operator i will run your ass over if you get within 10 feet of me. this is crazy, people on here faulting op for choosing their health and life over money/a job. you know this thing is bad when the chinese decided to shut down their country and hurt their economy temporarily. their gov doesn\\'t normally care that a few hundred or thousand die. not sure if this will help, but i wrote this because i have some similar thoughts:     most employees putting work in place do not want to be willing to take the risk of becoming infected with covid-19, but they also don‚Äôt want to make a career limiting decision and seem unwilling to work with an ominous economic outlook.  most employers are allowing workers to work from home if the work allows them to.  the administrative employees of construction depend on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or craftworker who are actually putting work in place.  stopping work as a safety decision due to covid19 would have to be done with serious analysis and consideration for workers and workers\\' families.  due to the different employment contracts of union vs admin employee, it is not likely that a union/craftworker will be willing to stop work if everyone around them is willing to work.  peer pressure, age discrimination, and family situations provide a pressure which a craftworker would not be willing to stop working in an environment with a threat such as the covid-19 virus around...   since a pandemic of this scale hasn\\'t happened since the 1918 flu (commonly known as the spanish flu), it is understandable that we have not had time to provide measures to allow us to work safely in a pandemic work environment.  being that we are concerned enough to have our administrative staff working from home, we should look at the measures to ensure that we provide our workers on site with a safe environment.  this would include at a minimum:   1. provide necessary ppe (rubber gloves and dust mask or respirators which may not be available at the moment) 2. provide disinfectant/sanitizing liquids for common tools/surfaces  3. look out for site conditions that could be problematic (not enough hand washing stations, having hand soap, crowded work areas, community shuttles, etc.) 4. crowded project where workers have to be within 6‚Äô of each other. 5. consider regular health checks of temperature and respiratory at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. 6. allow workers to clean common surfaces in areas where they are about to start working or in equipment that is commonly touched. (this may require more time)  i assume that our company is working on putting together more information for our on-site employees as more information is available with a process for our on-site employees.  there are some projects that we will not have control over things like community shuttles and being able to stay 6‚Äô away from each other (this may not be allowable for unloading the traditional way).  these scenarios will provide a higher risk of possible infection.  the first approach should be to find a process in which we can complete work more efficiently outside of the jobsite (prefabrication is a practice we already do).  along with seeing if we can work during off hours/swing shifts to avoid crowded work spaces.  our clients (general contractors/construction managers) may not like the proposed ideas along with the time required, but as this situation is new to our industry (and possibly the world), we should look to become opportunistic in finding different ways to complete work and decrease risk for our own employees.  we don‚Äôt know how long the social distance requirements will last to slow down the epidemic, but we should look for solutions to working in this (hopefully) temporary reality.    to conclude, as a last approach, i will stop work if i don‚Äôt feel it is safe for our men to work onsite if the work environment is likely to spread the covid19 virus.  while a lot of things are uncertain, i find that it is **part** of my job duties to provide a safe work environment and avoid putting our employees and their families  at risk.    this is not an argument of work being essential, it‚Äôs about keeping our workers safe.  just because work is essential does not mean we should take greater risk at the expense of our employees putting work in place. i work for a gc and i‚Äôm low enough i‚Äôm not making any calls about shutdowns but i hear the conversations with the owners. it bothers me so much that the only thing that gets discussed is how long will delays be and how much will it cost. i have not once heard a single owner or my own company discuss whether or not it‚Äôs safe for the guys in the field to keep the sites open. i can‚Äôt believe as much as every acts like safety comes first that it‚Äôs not a bigger part of the conversation.   construction is essential is a fucking joke. essential for what? the economy. you can always ask for a lay-off. same thing in ohio for me currently. our state shelter in place order lists certain types of construction as essential but it\\'s extremely vague. it\\'s complete bull shit because there\\'s a lot left open to interpretation that companies seem to be using as a loop hole to leave all sites running like normal. i wish higher up execs would have the balls to tell clients to shut down truly non-essential sites. for example, i\\'m building a new cafe in an existing office building, real essential..... i‚Äôm kinda curious to know what you mean by toxic masculinity. i understand where you‚Äôre coming from just hang in there and be safe im working in chicago ,contractor i work for cut down crews by the bunch and completely shut down some jobs . only 1 allowed in the elevator at a time drags getting up and down my jobs site in the california bay area is shutdown right now.  we got sent home the moment they ordered shelter in place. it‚Äôs a union job building a parking garage so maybe it‚Äôs not essential work, i‚Äôm not sure when we‚Äôre going back. i personally can‚Äôt see us staying shutdown too long because time is money. today california officially titled construction essentials work too so that might change things. i do commercial stuff. like maybe one part of one of my projects gets to stay open right now. got a call from a painter earlier... i dont think hes essential. did you seriously bring up toxic masculinity? i don\\'t think construction is the right industry for you... just tell your boss your going into voluntary isolation.    the people at fucking whataburger are still working, the people at circle k are still working,  the people at amazon are still working ‚Äî you‚Äôll be fine.    talk to my bartender about this because she‚Äôd probably suck a cock for $200 at this point we are building an abortion clinic right is that essential lol glad guys are walking off the job shut up pussy it is essential. you should be happy you still have a job and can work. [deleted] you don‚Äôt like it or scared go home there‚Äôs a bunch of ppl currently without work who are hoping daddy government is going to give them money to get thru the next couple months.  be grateful you have work because there‚Äôs probably a million or more people who would love a chance to earn money right about now. i 4 one am very happy that florida hasn\\'t shut down, i like most construction workers i know spend it as fast as i make it. idiot. you americans seem very scared of this virus, perhaps it\\'s your culture, you guys seem to love the idea of a doomsday.   might be your lack of universal healthcare, with that said many people are scared in sweden too. [removed] with pool plaster you have to fill the pool (or hot tub in this case) with water the same day you put the plaster on. water is necessary to cure the plaster, this could also be a leak test. looks ludicrous, based on my limited experience building a pool. they shouldn\\'t fill any water until like 10 days cure time after the tiling so if the hot tub tiling has been done for that long why isn\\'t there any tiling in the rest of the pool? what\\'s the benefit of filling it with water at this point anyways? now you have people working next to a filled pool but they\\'ll have to drain it soon anyways. what‚Äôs the problem with that? get your bathing suit on, grab a corona with lime and finish that puppy! he still has to drill up into that concrete lip hanging over the top of the hot tub. i didn\\'t know they sold under water drills, lol. lol. *somebody* couldn\\'t wait.  i worked on a similar pool/spa combo last year‚Äî those radius corners are a bitch in glass mosaic!! and ours had the radius on verticals too, which required some serious math. that part of my brain may never recover.   even the tile itself is similar. (bisazza?) blame it in the subs when you explain to the homeowner that he has to swim in primer finishing dust'"
